CHAPTER 3

DETAILED AREA DEVELOPMENT PLAN
3.0

INTRODUCTION
Chapter-3 contains the detailed area plan proposals and other relevant overviews, observations
and proposals. The plan has been devised under the framework of Master Plan, 2001 that serves
as the higher-level plan.

3.1

REVIEW OF HIGHER LEVEL FRAMEWORK
Structure Plan and Master Plan (2nd tier) are the two hierarchical components of 2001 Master Plan.
This Detailed Area Development Plan (DADP) has been prepared based on these two upper level
plans.
3.1.1 Structure Plan Policies
The ToR asks to review the policies of the Structure Plan before drawing up planning proposals.
Since the current DADP is a continuation of the 2001 Master Plan, the Structure Plan policies have
their implications in the current planning exercise. Policies are usually formulated for a long period
of time. As this DADP is prepared within the valid period of the Structure Plan, its policies are still
valid for DADP. Whenever, the consultant makes minor deviation from the policies of the Structure
Plan or formulates a new policy, proper arguments are shown in its favor.
3.1.1.1

Projected Population

Khulna Master Plan, 1961 assumed that the population of its jurisdiction would increase at a rate
of 2.50% per annum, thus, the total population of Khulna City area would reach 2,35,000 while
that of the Master Plan area (1961) would be 4,00,000 by the year 1981 (Khulna Master Plan, Vol.II, p.43). In reality, however, the projected population of Khulna City for 1981 surpassed in 1974,
when it reached 4,37,000. In 1981, the population of Khulna Master Plan area reached 6,65,000.
The 2001 Master Plan report made a medium projection of 32,58,027 population for 2020, of
which about 55% was projected to be migrated population (Khulna Master Plan 2001,Vol.-II,
Structure Plan, p. 46). For this current project, the consultant has forecasted a total population of
16,62,294 for the year 2023.
3.1.1.2

Policies on Population Density

Khulna Master Plan 1961 anticipated a net population density of 130 ppa. The plan also suggested
that 80% of the land for housing would be developed with an average density of 130 ppa, while the
remaining 20% areas with only 30 ppa net. Master Plan 2001 projected 125 persons as the peracre gross density by 2010 in the core area of the city and expected that by 2020 it would raise up
to 185.03 ppa (Khulna Master Plan 2001, Vol.-II, Structure Plan p. 54).
There has been steady rise of the density of population in Khulna City since early 60s. Following
the war of liberation, there was a sudden jump in the density due to rise in population. Density of
Khulna City rose from only 7 ppa in 1961 to 38 ppa in 1974, an increase of about 54.2%. Then
gradually the rate of density fell as the rate of migration went down following melt down of the local

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

economy. This situation continued till 1991, after that the density was found moving upward again
in 2001 when it was the highest with 75 ppa or 1842 persons/sq.km.
The population of Noapara Paurashava having an area of 25.12 sq.km had a population of 85,000
as per 2001 population census report. Density of population in Noapara Paurashava as per the
same report was 3384 persons/sq.km or 14 ppa. Khulna Master Plan 2001 observed the density of
population doubling in KCC area in 25 years, from 38 ppa in 1974 to 76.36 ppa in 1998. The outer
zone had a density of 6.44 ppa compared to core area with 76 ppa in 1998.
3.1.1.3

Economy and Employment Policy

The Structure Plan, on analyzing of the contemporary economic conditions of the city, predicted
future directions of the economy and recommended policy proposals for its uplift. The plan
recommended to make poverty reduction as the major objective of the development plan and
emphasized to keep hardcore poverty at lower level. Revival of the jute sector was set as a major
source of employment. The plan expected informal sector to play important role in employment
generation, where a significant section of the urban labour force is employed.
3.1.1.4

Housing Sector Policy

The Structure Plan report identified, about 7% of the city’s households not having proper housing.
Regarding housing occupancy, the report found 27% of the households living in one room house,
mostly in slums and squatters. In terms of floor space, 70% households used less than 800 sq. ft.
The poor households living in slums and squatters used only 400 sq. ft. on average. The report
estimated a housing need of 1,32,113 units in KCC area in the year 2020. After analysis, the
report set 11 policy recommendations for improvement of housing. The key points of the housing
policy recommendations along with the consultant’s recommendation are as follows•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

the concerned development agencies should serve as facilitators in housing
development;
KDA to assist public sector agencies for development of their housing schemes;
KDA to provide assistance to undertake housing schemes under the private sector;
KDA to provide affordable housing to the low income groups;
KDA and other agencies to create necessary infrastructure to facilitate land and housing
development;
planning intervention to be made by KDA in the spontaneously developed areas;
upgrading of slums and squatters;
monitoring of land and housing market;
facilitate finance and investment in the housing sector;
develop participatory programmes in the housing sector;
innovation of appropriate technology in low income housing development;
promotion of high rise buildings to attain maximum efficiency of municipal services
provision;
creating options of community facilities in different planned and unplanned residential
areas.

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

For housing development, Structure Plan made responsible the agencies like, LGED, NHA, KDA,
HBFC for executing the housing policies and expected that these and other public sector agencies
would pursue the policies to bridge the gap between the housing need and production of housing
units. Most of these policies are reflections of the national housing policy.
3.1.1.5

Traffic and Transport Sector Policy

The Structure Plan made an analysis of the current transport situation in the city where it observes
good external connectivity. The city was found dominated by non-motorized traffic. Due to low
level of economic activity the public transport system had not been well developed, the report
observes. On review of the transportation situation the Structure Plan made 16 policy
recommendations to improve traffic and transportation conditions in Khulna. After intensive review
of the structure plan policies, the consultant proposes the following intervention areas including the
ones identified by the Structure Plan:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
3.1.1.6

incremental development of proposed road network;
introduction of efficient city bus service and open new routes;
construction of new bus terminal/station;
development of new truck terminal;
introduce road network standard;
develop hierarchical road network at neighborhood level;
widening of existing narrow roads;
introduction of commuter train service;
waterway ghat development;
development of transport stands;
improvement of air transport;
locating transport terminals close to major roads of the City;
proper regulation of rickshaw and rickshaw van;
coordination of transport system;
develop footpath on all city roads.
designing user friendly footpath for easy and convenient movement of pedestrians;
designing safer and efficient intersections;
developing cycling tracks and popularizing cycling in the city;
promotion of street arboriculture.
Drainage Policy

Structure Plan identified that 68% of the households did not have any drainage facilities. There is
no underground drainage system in the city. Drainage in the fringe and sub-urban areas was
unsatisfactory. Low lying areas in the north and south are subject to water-logging due to heavy
rains and tidal water during rainy season. The report found city khals mostly encroached, drains
unable to carry water as filled with trash. Drains are narrow and uncoordinatedly developed. With a
view to improve the drainage condition, the report proposed following six policy recommendations.
The consultants added two more policies:
•
•

preparation of storm water drainage improvement plan;
phase-wise implementation of drainage improvement plan;

environmental improvement through improved drainage system;
non-structural measures to protect right of way and other aspects;
regular operation and maintenance of the drainage system;
NGOs, CBOs and civil society involvement in drainage system management;
retention of natural drainage systems;
protection of cannels and rivers through providing walkways, boundary fencing and
plantation along the banks
Water Supply Policy

Analyzing the existing water supply situation, the report focused on access to water supply by the
city people and made a projection of water demand up to the year 2020. It also explored the
potential ground water sources and their water quality. Finally, the report put forward some policies
regarding improvement of water supply as stated below along with the new policies proposed by
the consultants:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
3.1.1.8

rehabilitation of existing piped water supply system;
exploration of new sources of ground water;
exploration of new surface water sources;
creation of new independent agency for water supply;
investigation on ground water quality;
protection and restoration of existing surface water sources;
ensure surface water quality.
Sanitation Policy

Structure Plan reviewed the existing sanitary facilities available in the city. Ongoing sanitation
projects were reviewed and future sanitation needs were assessed. It reveals that 31% of the
households use unsanitary latrines comprising katcha and surface latrines. Next, the report made
proposals for sanitation improvement with structural and non-structural measures. A set of policies
are to be followed for future sanitation development as sated below:
•
•
•
•
•
•
3.1.1.9

production and supply of adequate number of pit latrine components;
promotion of public toilet facility throughout the city;
creation of awareness about healthy sanitation at school level;
development of network based integrated sanitary system with treatment facility;
promotion and introduction of innovative, appropriate and sustainable sanitation
technologies;
promotion of community managed sanitation facilities for the lower-income group.
Solid Waste Management Policy

Regarding solid waste management, the Structure Plan reviewed the condition of solid waste
management and made a future assessment about waste generation. It stated that by 2020 AD,
922 tons of solid waste will be generated in KCC area and an additional 301 tons of waste will be
generated in the extended area each day. It also suggested some sites for solid waste disposal.
Suggestion was also made about adoption of various methods of solid waste management. Lastly,

DDC-DATEX

the report put forward a set of policies for solid waste management. Including the consultant’s
proposals, following are the policies related to solid waste management:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

improvement of collection efficiency;
separate management of medical waste;
recycling of solid waste;
increase the role of NGOs and CBOs in solid waste management;
introduction of controlled dumping method;
monitoring of solid waste collection, disposal and recycling;
devising appropriate solid waste management method for areas beyond KCC;
formulation of solid waste management guidelines for different kinds of stakeholders
(e.g. households, commercial usages etc.).

3.1.1.10 Health Sector Policy
The Structure Plan reviewed the existing health care facilities both at public and private sector. It
also discussed the diseases pattern among the people. The recommended policy measures are
stated below:
•
•
•
•
•
•

improvement of general health infrastructure;
creating poor’s access to health services;
primary health care at the neighborhood level;
strengthening preventive health care services;
health awareness building;
location of public health care facilities as per need.

secondary and tertiary level in greater Khulna. At the end, it put forward some policy
recommendations as stated below:
•
•
•

establishment of quality primary and nursery schools at neighborhood level;
sufficient space to be reserved in schools for play field;
all categories of schools including vocational, to be provided in the Master Plan.

3.1.1.13 Industrial Sector Policy

•
•
•
•

Structure Plan, in its report, made proposals for delineation of sites for local industrial
development. After review of industrial sector of the city, the report made a series of policy
recommendations:
creation of industrial incentive zone; relocation of hazardous enterprises;
organize footloose industries; encouragement to small scale industries;
reorganization and restructuring of large scale manufacturing;
Control of industrial location and standard.

3.1.1.14 Conservation of Urban Heritage Policy
The Structure Plan prepared a list of the heritage sites and buildings of different historical periods
and made suggestions for their conservation and management. It also proposed to erect a land
mark monument. This suggestion was made to use the land mark as symbol of Khulna City. The
report put forward some policy recommendations for conservation of local heritage. Structure Plan
report recommended the following policies for conservation of local heritage:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

conservation of old and prestigious areas;
listing all heritage sites and old historical buildings;
restriction on incompatible and alteration of old historical buildings;
eviction of unauthorized and incompatible uses of heritage/ historical buildings;
old historic buildings and sites to be conserved for the tourists and visitors;
development of Khulna Tower (or it can be named as Millennium Tower);
all sites of Liberation War depicting the glorious history of our independence should be
preserved and developed properly.
3.1.1.15 Environmental Management Policy
The Structure Plan report discussed the management issues of the city environment and reviewed
the stakeholders of environmental management and the relevant legal framework. Next,
recommended some policy measures as stated below:
• proper treatment of waterlogged areas and enforcement of relevant laws;
• protection and maintenance of surface water bodies;
• relocation of hazardous and red industries from high density residential areas;
• enforcement of environmental laws.
3.1.1.16 Plan Implementation and Governance Policy
Both, Khulna Master Plan 1961 and 2001 set forth measures required for plan implementation.
Khulna Master Plan 1961 in its Chapter-12 under the title “Planning Administration and
Implementation” made recommendations about administration and execution of the plan. The
planning report suggested that all planning matters should be handled by a single authority. It
would also be the executing authority for all planning functions. The plan called for retaining the
matter of housing with KDA. The report termed planning as a continuous process. KDA fairly
followed the recommendations of the plan.
Regarding plan implementation, the Structure Plan part of Khulna Master Plan 2001, observed
inequality in the present institutional arrangements of city development agencies. It identified 33
government agencies responsible for execution of recommendations of the plan, where KDA and

DDC-DATEX

3-7

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

KCC are the two most vital ones. Administrative weakness and coordination of activities were
identified as major flaws of the present city administration.
The Structure Plan identified government intervention in the KCC and KDA administration as the
major hindrances to effective delivery of services. KCC’s service delivery was found less than
required, where fund scarcity was identified as the most important bottleneck. The plan suggested
capacity building of both KCC and KDA for carrying out development activities more effectively.
The plan put forward following three options for administrative rearrangement:
•
•
•

Functioning of existing multiple authorities with coordinating bodies;
KCC as the only city body abolishing KDA;
Creating a new city organization abolishing KCC and KDA.

Finally, the plan recommended establishing Khulna Metropolitan Development Authority as an
Apex Coordination body to coordinate development activities. Lastly, the plan made the following
policy recommendations make urban management and development institutions function more
efficiently,

3.2

• Mobilization of resources;
• Capacity building of urban development agencies;
• Introducing MIS and GIS systems in KDA;
• Inter-agency conflict resolution;
• Partnership development for plan implementation;
• People’s participation in urban development.
PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS
Planning principles are guidelines based on which development proposals are drawn up. They are
used as guidelines for systematic planning. Almost all planning standards are based on the size of
future population it is going to serve.
The Terms of Reference (ToR) of the project asks to set planning principles and standards to
address two distinct areas- existing urban area and new urban area. Development in these two
areas will be small scale incremental and large scale planned respectively. So, the principles in
two areas will be different, the ToR said. Whereas the new urban areas offer opportunities to
develop areas in an ideal way, the existing urban areas in most cases will be gradual and
improvement type, where restructuring is ‘feasible and desirable.’ Regarding use of standard in
existing urban area, the ToR says, “Here design principles and standards cannot be implemented
right away, but serve rather as a reference, or target, to be approximated to a degree that depends
on available budget, willingness of local inhabitants to co-operate, ability of the formal developers
to ’adopt’ these principles and standards”. It calls for taking more care in drawing up principles in
case of existing areas and take opportunities offered by new areas for organized development to
accommodate higher density. In the backdrop of above deliberations of the ToR, the consultant
sets the following planning principles for existing and new urban areas following the Master Plan,
2001.
3.2.1 Recommended Planning Principles
Development of planning principles is easier said than done. ToR demands to develop planning
principles for both new and existing urban area. As, the definition of new and existing urban areas

DDC-DATEX

3-8

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

prescribed in the ToR is completely impractical, the planning principles developed in the following
section may not be totally applicable at this moment. Nonetheless, appreciating the concept, the
consultant proposes the following planning principles for new and existing urban areas for future
use.
3.2.1.1

Planning Principles for Existing Urban Areas

The following planning principles are proposed for existing urban areas:
•
•
•
•
•
•
3.2.1.2

Cause minimum possible affect to existing structures while proposing new infrastructure
or existing infrastructure improvement.
Use minimum space for providing common facilities.
Make multiple use of same space for common facilities wherever possible as a space
saving approach.
Cause minimum displacement of permanent residents.
Keep provision for resettlement of land / house owners affected by implementation of
development proposals.
Keep development proposals at reasonably minimum to avoid affecting existing
residents and avoid public opposition and budget failure.
Planning Principles for New Urban Areas

The following principles are proposed for new urban areas:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ensure maximum possible planned development of new/vacant areas.
Propose urban centres at suitable locations, preferably, in hierarchical manner, in order
to create activity areas.
Use minimum space for providing common facilities.
To save land, ensure multiple use of same space for community facilities.
Provide local level roads minimum 300 ft. Apart.
While lands are acquired compulsorily for development, compensates land owners with
land elsewhere in the city.
Use hierarchy in road network development.
Provide adequate number of play field and park in areas where total planned
development will not be possible.
Preserve the existing khals and other khas water bodies as they are to ease drainage
flow and water retention during rainy season.

3.2.2 Standards
2001 Master Plan developed standards for the Master Plan. These standards are well suited for
the current DADP. In the following sections standards that have been adopted for plan making
have been presented. In some cases, the Master Plan standards have gone through minor
modifications to cope with changed circumstances.

3.2.2.1

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

Recommended Area Development Standard

The project ToR in Step-7-1 (p. 97) suggests density control and incremental development
techniques as the standards for area development. It suggested adoption of the
following techniques for existing urban area development:
•
•
•
•
•

Urban Renewal
Land Readjustment
Guided Land Development
Site and Services
Community Based Participatory Area Development

The ToR recommended applying community based development techniques in existing urban
areas where there is very little vacant space remains for development. In places, where some
unoccupied space is available, Guided Land Development may be applied. Areas having larger
tracts of open land Site and Services method, Land Readjustment Technique, Land acquisition or
Land purchase for infrastructure development would be better solutions.
It is observed from ToR that a wide range of flexibility is there regarding use of standards for
existing as well as new areas. For area development, the standards proposed by the ToR have
been categorized by the consultant in respect of applicable area. The techniques that is more
suitable for existing area will not be used for new areas. Following are the applicable area wise
techniques to be adopted.
•

Area Development Techniques for Existing Urban Areas

Following techniques are suggested for area development in existing urban area by the public
sector urban development agencies:
 Guided Land Development
 Community Based Participatory Area Development.
•

Area Development Techniques for New Urban Areas

Following techniques are suggested for area development in new urban area by the public sector
urban development agencies:




3.2.2.2

Land Readjustment
Guided Land Development
Site and Services
Community Based Participatory Area Development.
Recommended Infrastructure and Services Standards

Standards set down a system of allocation of space for infrastructure and service facilities. In most
cases, population forms the basis of determining the same. Some standards are designed
according to need. The ToR did not say anything about the planning standards that are to be
followed for providing the infrastructure and services in the DADP area. Standards were provided
in the 2001 Master Plan for Khulna. The Master Plan adopted these standards for providing the
infrastructure and services. Regarding new urban area, the ToR said that since the entire area
would be free and open, there would be “more freedom to adopt formal design principles.” It calls

DDC-DATEX

3-10

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

for designing the new urban area with major infrastructure, like, road, drainage and public
transportation. The ToR document also calls for updating the Structure Plan and Master Plan
infrastructure proposals. It did not, however, directs to formulate new standards for providing
infrastructure and services for new urban areas.
In most cases, the consultant follows the standards for infrastructure and services provided
by Khulna Master Plan 2001. This is because significant change in the standard will cause
significant change in the proposed land use. This will create conflict with the existing land use
zoning (proposed by 2001 Master Plan). These standards will be used in flexible way. In case of
complexities minor changes may be made whenever necessity demands. Following are the
standards to be adopted for the current project:
a.
i.

Community Services and Facilities
Recreational Open Space

Minimum 0.45 acre of open space for every 1000 population. The standard has been lowered from
what was followed in 2001 Master Plan, because that was more ambitious. None of the open
space proposals recommended in the 2001 Master Plan based on above standard was
implemented.
ii.

Primary School

One school for every 3,400 populations with 1.40 acre to 2.95 acre for each.
iii.

Secondary School

One secondary school for every 5,000 populations with minimum 1.27 to 1.92 acre to for each.
iv.

College

One college for every 36,000 populations with approximately 5.36 acres for each.
v.

Private University

12 (Twelve) to 20 (Twenty) acre for one university as per the criteria of University Grants
Commission
b.

Road Standard

Structure Plan in its Transport Policy-5 and Transport Policy-6 made some recommendations
about road standard as shown below. Recommendations have been made for different categories
of roads in the form of Right of Way (RoW).
i.

Neighborhood Level Road Standard and Hierarchy

The consultant observed that it is difficult to implement 20 ft. RoW road standard (proposed by
Khulna Master Plan 2001) in case of a re-development of a spontaneously developed
neighborhood. It is also not possible practically to create road hierarchy in such areas, as they are
already developed. However, considering the safety issues, the consultant’s recommends to
uphold the 2001 Master Plan Proposal (minimum road width as 20 ft) for any improvement/redevelopment plan/detailed area plan. This width will ensure two-way movements of the
ambulances and fire brigade vehicles in case of emergencies. For planned residential areas

DDC-DATEX

3-11

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

undertaken either by public or by private agencies the standard and hierarchy of roads should be
as follows:
Major Road
Feeder Road
Access Road

:
:
:

50 ft. to 80 ft. wide
30 ft. to less than 50 ft. wide
Less than 30 ft. (but not below 20 ft.) (Normal)

But in special cases, such as slum and squatter resettlement areas neighborhood roads may
be allowed up to 12 ft. This is to make such projects viable and supply land to beneficiaries at
affordable cost. This width will ensure at least one ambulance and a rickshaw to move side by side
at a time or one fire brigade vehicle in case of emergencies or outbreak of fire. The consultant
proposes to widen all roads (with less than 12 feet width) within the existing built up areas
sequentially to at least 12 feet width. However, for the current DADP, no roads have been
proposed with less than 20 feet width.

: RoW Minimum – 20 ft. (6.09 m) (Community roads)

Bazars

One bazar for every 50,000 people (0.3 acre for each bazar)
d.

Graveyard, Cemetery or Crematorium

Master Plan did not provide any standard for Graveyard, cemetery or Crematorium. However, after
reviewing different planning documents, the current DADP proposes to allocate 1.08 to 13.20
acres for each of land for 50,000 populations for relevant faith.
e. Mosques, Mandirs and Churches
0.50 acre for every 5,000 populations for relevant faith.
3.3

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
3.3.1 Review of Khulna Urban Development Strategy of 2001 Master Plan
Before drawing up strategic options for development of urban Khulna, the 2001 Master Plan, in its
Khulna Urban Strategy (Vol. I), assumed some development parameters about population growth,
poverty level, in-migration, international export market fluctuation for shrimp. Next it went for
development of some strategic infrastructure as precondition for future development of the city.
These included the Rupsha Bridge, development of Mongla Port, development of an EPZ at
Mongla and an Airport for Khulna City and expedite completion of Dhaka-Mawa Road to reduce
distance between Dhaka and Khulna. It was thought that all these elements would serve as
propulsive forces for rapid development of the city.
Next, it looked for boosting investment in manufacturing and services to enhance the production
and employment bases of the city and its adjoining areas. It was apprehended that if improvement
of law and order situation and power supply could be ensured, there would be smooth flow of
private investment into the city. It was also recommended to streamline institutional and
administrative support including credit facilities and make them investment friendly. However, it

DDC-DATEX

3-12

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

emphasized on law and order, power and gas supply as priority tasks. Regarding spatial
development strategy of Khulna City, the report recommended to adopt a multi-centered and
decentralized urban strategy through development of satellite towns around the city. To develop
the east bank of the Bhairab and integrate with the main city, the report recommended develops a
bridge over the river Bhairab. To harness the potentials of tourism the report recommended
developing 50 km Rupsha-Bhairab riverfront from Batiaghata to Noapara and capitalizing these
rivers for economic and recreational development.
3.3.2 Recommended Development Strategy
The consultant expresses its solidarity with the strategies recommended by the 2001 Master Plan.
However, many of the recommendations of the strategies for future development of Khulna have
already been accomplished, like; Bridge over Rupsha, Dhaka-Mawa-Khulna Road, and EPZ at
Mongla Port. However, the local economy did not flourish to the level it was expected. This is
because probably many vital conditions have remained unfulfilled, like, sustainable power supply
and gas as a cheap energy. These are two vital elements, absence of which discourages growth
of industries in Khulna area as learnt through consultation with local Chamber, press and others.
The consultant recommends that power and gas facilities should be ensured to expedite
industrialization and consequent economic growth.
Further, to attract industrial investment emphasis should be laid on the strategy to develop special
economic zone, where all the services and facilities including energy supply will be ensured.
For urban infrastructure development, a policy of participatory development should be adopted
instead of land acquisition based development. This is necessary to reduce cost of infrastructure
development at local level and create belongingness among the land owners about development
and make execution of infrastructure projects easier.
New sources should be evolved to finance urban infrastructure development including charging
development cost on the beneficiaries and imposition tax on vacant land. There is provision of
charging betterment fee in KDA Ordinance. It should be explored and used for revenue
generation. All the dues pending with (2% of KCC tax revenue) other agencies should be
realized to pay for infrastructure development.
Coordination with other local agencies involved in urban development is necessary to avoid
wastage of resources.
3.4

DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS
The current DADP comprises development proposals under various sectors that are mostly
infrastructures of social and physical in nature. These include road, education, graveyard, parks,
playgrounds, health facilities etc. The Project Area comprises 78.38% of the study area, therefore,
a substantial part of the 2001 Master Plan development proposals are applicable to the project
area. Almost all infrastructure development proposals of the 2001 Master Plan fall within the
project area. After reviewing the proposals, the consultant proposed the appropriate change in the
proposals and in most cases the proposals have been retained in the current DADP. Following are
the sector wise description of DADP development proposals.

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

3.4.1 Transport Sector Development Proposals
Despite having no provision for transport sector development in the ToR, the consultant realizing
the necessity of the issue on public interest, made some transport sector development proposals.
3.4.1.1
a.

Road Network Development

2001 Master Plan Road Network Proposal

The 2001 Master Plan proposed 447 km of road network for the study area, of which 434 km falls
within the project area. These consist of primary and secondary roads. The plan recommended
120.60 km primary road, of which KDA and RHD implemented 32.75 km as Outer Bypass and
Rupsha Bridge Approach Road. KDA developed 16.44 km City Bypass. Of the proposed
secondary road length, only two road projects proposed by Master Plan, 2001 are under execution
totaling about 3 km.
b.

DADP Road Network Development Proposal

It is evident from the review of proposed road network of 2001 Master Plan that extremely
negligible length of the road proposals has so far been implemented (about 3 km). All the
proposed roads of Master Plan serve as the higher-level frameworks for the current DADP. The
consultant, therefore, retaining most of the Master Plan road proposals mostly as it is and draws
up the lower level roads to serve the local areas. However, alignments of some major roads have
been reconsidered to ensure maximum use of existing road network and also to save huge
amount of structures. The development proposals have been made based on the road standards
drawn from the 2001 Master Plan. The main objective of road layout is to provide accessibility to
undeveloped or underdeveloped areas with maximum possible standard road with respect to
layout and width. Roads have been laid out in the project area minimum 400 ft. apart for the
underdeveloped areas.
The proposed roads have been designed, mainly with a view to open up undeveloped areas by
linking with major and secondary existing roads and the roads proposed by the Master Plan.
Proposals have also been made to widen the existing narrow roads, wherever situation permits.
Currently, mainly two categories of roads have been proposed following standards, these are
feeder road (30 ft.) and access road (20 ft.) to serve local areas. Feeder Roads are those roads
that connect any undeveloped area with existing major and secondary road. Access Roads are
the roads that give access to any undeveloped area from any secondary or access road. Roads of
greater width haven proposed wherever possible and feasible and based on need.
i.

Khulna City Corporation (KCC) Area

As KCC area is the most densely populated part of the project area, new roads are almost
impossible to propose. However, to resolve some of the problems like missing links, network
inconsistency etc., a total of 87.44 km new roads have been proposed within the boundary of KCC,
most of these roads are 10-20 feet wide (25.63 km) and 30-40 feet wide (10.08 km), 50-60 feet
wide (5.09 km), 70-80 feet wide (20.57 km) and 100 feet wide takes (0.45 km). The areas where
most of the new roads are proposed are located on the north-western and southern periphery and
have higher potentiality for growth in future as they have City Bypass within their close proximity.

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

As it is the oldest and naturally grown part of the project area, there are numerous narrow roads
contributing to the decreasing quality of built environment, increasing vulnerability to disasters.
Therefore, a total of 25.59 km existing roads are proposed for widening. Most of these roads are
proposed to be widened up to 20 feet (about 10 km). Wider roads could not be proposed because
the areas that do not have any accessibility. On implementation of the proposed roads, land value
in these areas will rise and new development will start. This will generate new employment and
help move the local economy forward.
Apart from all of these, a new embankment cum road has been proposed on the Bank of Bhairab
all the way from Noapara to Rupsha. Out of about 47.57 km road, 19.70 km has fallen within the
boundary of KCC. Width of this road cum embankment is 80 feet.
ii. Noapara Paurashava Area
In Noapara Paurashava, the total new road network proposed under DADP is 80.86 km. The
existing highway passing through the Paurashava will be turned into an internal road after the
construction of new bypass on the western periphery of the town. New link roads have been
proposed connecting the bypass and exiting Khulna-Jessore road. Most of the proposed roads are
access roads are of 20 feet wide (3.21 km). About 4.96 km new road is proposed having 40 ft.
width.
One of the basic planning principles of this plan is optimum utilization of existing infrastructure.
Thus a total 31.16 km existing road is proposed for widening Table-3.2. The enumerated length of
the embankment cum road in Noapara is 9.86 km.
iii. Extended Area
Comparatively, more emphasis has been laid on new road development in Extended Area. Those
areas have been given priority that show trend of development and where new accessibility can
expedite the development. In Extended Area, 268.45 km of new roads have been proposed.
These comprise about 64 km of 20 feet wide road, about 25 km of 30 feet wide road and about 11
km of 60 feet wide road. The Extended Area is dominated by mostly farm land, where future
extension of the urban activities is likely to take place if growth in the main city area swells. New
road proposals are laid down in such a manner so that the maximum amount of agricultural land
can be saved. Thus most of the roads are laid down on the low density rural habitation. For details
of new road proposals please see Table-3.1. Some of the major roads are proposed through this
area to promote urbanization and development. Proposed Noapara Bypass Road has passed
through the extended area. Apart from the same, about 17.71 km long embankment cum road by
the Rupsha river has passed through this part of the project area.
Apart from the new roads, a total of 100.18 km. road in this area is proposed for widening. Detailed
zone wise road network is presented in Maps in Appendix-3.4. For the sake of better visualization,
transport related land use is isolated from circulation network in Map-3.13.

No roads with less than 10 ft. width have been proposed in the Project Area. However, in the map
some walkways are proposed with about 10 ft width. Total length of such walkways would not
exceed 5 km.
The 497th Board Meeting of KDA decided that all the existing roads with less than 3.65 m (12 feet)
width, should be widened to at least 12 feet. According to the minutes of the board meeting, in
case of less than 12 feet width, land owners of the both side of the road must register
proportionate amount of land to City Corporation, Mayor of Paurashava or Chairman of Union
Parishad for expansion of the existing road to get the no objection certificate (NOC) from KDA.
This decision is applicable on 23 mouzas; namely Muzgunni, Denerabad, Choto-boyra, Banargati,
Baniakhamar, Tutpara, Helatala, Boyra, Tutpara, Rayer Mahal, Pabla, Daulatpur, Deyana,
Goalpara, Aronghata, Labanchara, Harintana, Jabusa, Maheswarpasha, Gaikur, Jugipol, Moshiali
and Atra. After careful evaluation of the proposal of the Board Meeting, the consultant proposes
that no roads with less than 20 feet width should be allowed in the project area. And this principle
should be applicable for the whole study area except slum and squatters.

Public Transport

a.
New Bus Route
Currently, there is only one public bus route operating in the project area, running between Fultala
and Rupsha. In this 35 km route, 68 buses operate daily up and down. Other public transport
services are auto-rickshaw, battery-driven easy bike (latest introduction) and the rickshaw van, the
cheapest mode of public transport. All these transports operate in different routes of the city and
surroundings. 2001 Master Plan proposed 5 new bus routes in the city and surroundings. These
are, Noapara to Natun Bazar, Koya to Rupsha, Rupsha to Shiromoni following City Bypass,
Rupsha to Dighalia following outer bypass, Fulbari Gate to Rupsha through Khalishpur. But buses
did not start operating in any of these routes, because of dearth of passengers. Since the public
buses are operated by private operators, they did not find these routes economically feasible to
start new bus service. Since Khulna experiences slow economic growth, its employment and
population growths are also slow, introduction of new bus routes will be difficult for private
operators. However, as a long term strategy DADP proposes following seven new bus routes. A
few routes may be tried on experimental basis. The proposed new routes are:
Route-1: Noapara to Rupsha via outer bypass, Gallamari, Nirala and Moilapota
Route-2: Fultala to Rupsha via Khalishpur, Sonadanga, Gollamari, Moilapota

Map-3.1 shows the proposed new 7 routes. If private operators decline to operate anticipating
unprofitable, government may try some of these routes with BRTC buses.
b.

Metro Rail/ Tram Line

Khulna is a metropolitan city, but currently pace of economic growth is comparatively slower here.
Nonetheless, it is expected that with the commissioning of Padma Bridge and transit to
Bangladesh by Bhutan and Nepal through India new frontiers of investment will be opened up in
the south-western region centering Khulna. Because the city is imbued with the entire positive
factor for investment, like, good infrastructure, proximity to sea port, rich agricultural hinterland, low
land value, everything necessary to attract investment. New employments will be generated,
commercial and industrial developments will flourish. To promote new investment and attract
migrants, development of good infrastructure is imperative. The current DADP is designed for a
period of 10 years, that is, all its proposals will have to be executed within next 10 years. In the
long run, the city will have huge number of working class people and as the city has a linear shape,
metro/tram service will ease their travel to work place from north to south or south to north. The
consultant proposes tram service from Noapara upto beyond Rupsha. As the metro/tram will have
its dedicated line to operate, it will be free from traffic congestion and the journey will be
uninterrupted.
As long term transport development strategy this mass transport service has been incorporated in
the DADP. However, this proposal cannot be executed within next 10 years tenure of DADP. The
proposal should continue through coming city plans of Khulna to maintain its continuity. The logic
is that if land cannot be reserved for this services right now the facilities cannot be developed in
future when all land would be engulfed by intense development. The 45.29 km tram line will be
extended from the northern end of Noapara Paurashava to Khudir Battala in Rupsha area. The
alignment will run along the Khulna-Jessore Road and reach Khudir Battal crossing Rupsha river.
About 42.52 km metro rail alignment will start from Noapara to Rupsha Bridge going along the
Noapara Bypass and Khulna City Bypass. A new bridge will be needed on the Rupsha for this
purpose. This mass transit facility will help meet the future demand for local high speed transit that
will also be cheaper.

New Railway Line
Khulna Master Plan 2001 proposed to extend the western railway network up to Mongla Port to
facilitate effective use of Mongla Port facilities, serve EPZ and activate the economy of
Southwestern region. This project is now under implementation. It is expected that the project will
contribute to the economy largely. After finalization of the locations of the train stations, the
connecting roads with the city should be constructed on priority basis.
3.4.1.3

Pedestrian Movement

a. Walking on Footpath
Of the entire study area, footpath exists only in the core part of the Khulna City. Survey shows
only about 18.85 km of roads have footpath. Some of the roads have footpath on one side only.
The width of the footpaths varies from 4 ft. to 6 ft. According to Master Plan 2001, over 50% of the
city dwellers make their daily trips to work places on foot.
The city footpaths have varied problems that discourage pedestrians walking on them. Much of the
footpath width, in the busy areas of the city, is found to be occupied by the informal small business
people. This leaves little room for the pedestrians to walk. In these areas pedestrians are forced to
walk on the carriageway, which increases vulnerability of accident. In many areas footpaths are
not well maintained. They are either broken, or have open manholes, where walking is risky. In
some areas the width of footpath is not up to standard. For all these reasons, pedestrian try to
avoid footpaths of many busy areas.
Informal business activities are a major problem for pedestrians to walk in on footpath. But it is
extremely difficult to remove activities on footpath. Because these activities provide about 60%
urban employment. Mass eviction might result social disorder and deteriorate law and order
situation. The best way is to streamline footpath business activities and ensuring sufficient space
for pedestrians. At busy commercial areas tome based pedestrian precinct may be created. Under
such programme during peak shopping period all vehicular movement will be forbidden in a certain
part of the shopping area. This will allow free and comfortable movement of the shoppers.
Necessary arrangements may be made for transportation of goods.
b

Foot Over Bridge with Escalator

2001 Master Plan proposed two foot over bridges, one at (1) Power house crossing and (2)
Daulatpur near BL Collage. In the long run with the increase in population, the number of
pedestrians in the city streets will increase manifolds. Indiscriminate road crossing will have to be
stopped to bring discipline in movement in the streets as well as to ensure safety of the
pedestrians crossing the roads. Walk up stair based foot over bridges are usually not welcomed by
the pedestrians as they involve strains in minding stairs. To ease strains involved in walk up foot
over bridges, escalators may be set up with foot over bridges. Such foot over bridges with
escalator may be set up at busy intersections of the city. Additionally, considering the increased
vehicular movement, the consultant proposes 25 foot over bridges throughout the project area. It is
to be mentioned here that such high number of foot over bridges are not required in the project
area in the next 10 years. However, it has been proposed on request by KDA. Table-3.3 shows
the list of over bridges including the phases of their implementation phasing (locations are also
shown in MAP-3.2).

Railway Overpass at Fulbari Gate and Noapara

The 2001 Master Plan proposed a railway overpass at the Fulbari Gate railway crossing. Within
KDA area, the roadway crosses railway line at three points- Jora Gate, Fubari Gate and Bhanga
Gate area of Noapara. 2001 Master Plan proposed a railway overpass at Fulbari Gate. But it was
not built as the traffic at this point is yet to be very high. In the long run, there will be need for the
overpass to smoothen traffic movement without any delay at this railway closure. Similar overpass
will be required in future at Bhanga gate area where road crosses the railway line.

Proposal on Central Area Development

i.

2001 Master Plan Review

2001 Master Plan proposed to develop an 80 feet wide road from Kahlishpur Port Staff Quarter
area up to Rupsha Ghat along the Rupsha River, passing by the northern side of Baron Bazar. But
the road was not built. The plan also proposed to develop a city bus stand on the unused Ferry
Ghat space. The plan proposed to re-organize railway market with arrangement of shopping areas
and creation of more and better access roads to facilitate more efficient operation of commercial
activities in the area. But none of these proposals was executed.
ii.

DADP Recommendation

Dakbangla area is considered as the main commercial-administrative hub of Khulna City. This
area is extended from the Ferry Ghat more at the north, Bangladesh Bank more at the south, Phul
market at the west and the River Bhairab at the East. Biggest wholesale markets (Boro Bazar),
Office of the KCC, Khulna Court, Khulna prison, numerous banks, offices, shops and shopping
malls are located within close proximity of this area. Main problems of this area area. Traffic congestion during the official time especially in Dakbanglow to picture place more

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

b. High concentration of street hawkers narrowing down the effective width of the roads.
c. Some land uses like cinema halls attract too much crowd during office hours. There are
three cinema halls in this area.
d. This is the oldest and unplanned part of Khulna City. Most of the roads are quite narrow.
Because of very dense structures by the roads, there is very little opportunity to widen the
existing roads or building new ones.
e. Road intersections are not properly designed to ensure smooth traffic flow.
Considering this as the most problematic and also most important part of Khulna City, the
consultant makes the following proposals for improvement of circulation system in the area–
•

Some parts of this area may be declared as a pedestrian zone. The Clay Road from DakBangla Intersection up to the River Rupsha in Baro-Bazar and the KD-Ghosh Road from
Khulna Thana Intersection up to Boro-Bazar intersection and the Sir Iqbal Road from
Khulna Thana Intersection up to Khulna Thana Intersection may be brought under this
programme. Being a commercial area there will need for loading and unloading goods.
For this purpose, all categories of vehicles may be allowed to operate from 9:00 pm at
night to 6:30 am in the morning. Rest of the hours the area will remain free of all
pedestrian traffic. Rickshaws may be allowed to enable consumers to reach shops and
carry their goods home.

•

Apart from the existing baby taxi stand at Dak Bangla area (approximately 8700 sq.ft.),
another parking place has to be established at Power House area (opposite of Mina
Bazar). This is because the existing baby taxi stand has already reached its saturation
level and baby taxies over spill into the nearby street creating traffic congestion. The new
parking place will also serve as the proposed multi-modal transport terminal close to the
launch terminal.

•

A new 30 feet wide road should be developed on the northern boundary of Baro Bazar
along the Rupsha River, connecting Station Road with Sir Iqbal Road. This road will
protect the Rupsha River from encroachment by Baro Bazar shop owners at the same
time; it will create new and wide access to Baro Bazar. This road will ease off
transportation of goods form and to the Boro-Bazar. No opening of frontage of the shops
to this road should be allowed. Tracks can be unloaded at the Boro-Bazar between 9:00
pm at night to 6:30 am at the morning and leave the area following newly proposed road
to go to Zoragate where the drivers can rest or pick their vehicle.

•

Following the proposals of Master Plan 2001, the current plan also retains the proposal of
a Multi-modal transport terminal at the current location of the Khulna Railway station and
IWTA launch ghat. The plan proposed to integrate these stations together with the road
transport terminal to implement a modern multi-modal transport terminal in this area,
which could become a land mark for the city.

•

The CBD area has already become saturated by different kinds of services. Following the
process of invasion and succession of land use, this area is now expanding towards
western direction. To provide scope for the CBD to expand towards eastern direction, the
current DADP proposes to implement the Bridge close to the launch ghat over the river

DDC-DATEX

3-22

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

Bhairab. The consultant proposes to discard the proposed optional bridge at Khalishpur
and retains the proposal for another bridge at Mirerdanga. The DADP made no locational
allocation for this bridge at Mirerdanga.
3.4.1.4

Transport Stands and Terminals

Master Plan 2001 made a couple of proposals about the bus stands and babi taxi stands. The
consultant thinks that the proposals are still valid and recommends implementing the proposals as
soon as possible.
Because of westward direction of growth of the city, the consultant thinks that within couple of
years, the current inter-city bus terminal at Sonadanga will not be able to meet the demand of the
of the city. The consultant envisioned that the Sonadanga bus terminal will not be serving as the
Inter-city bus terminal. Instead, it will serve as the intra-city bus terminal.
Moreover, after construction of the Padma Bridge at Mawa point, the current flow of bus traffic
(Khulna via Jessore to Dhaka) will be reduced. More pressure will be created on the southern
route (Khulna via Bhanga to Dhaka).This will necessitate another bus terminal at the southern part
of the city. Thus the consultant proposes another bus terminal on an area of 9 acres at Jalma
mouza near the proposed railway station (1:3960 sheet no. G03, DADP Zone 21) Map-3.1.
Additionally, the consultant also proposes a truck terminal by the bus terminal on an area of 7.22
acre. This truck terminal will serve the proposed the wholesale market close to the truck terminal.
Consultant considering the commercial and industrial importance of Noapara proposes a truck
terminal on the northern end of the Paurashava in Ward No-1. For Noapara a bus terminal has
been proposed in Ward No. 4 close to the proposed bypass. Please see Table-3.4 and 3.5. for
details.

Easy Bike and Motorised Rickshaw Management

The number of battery driven auto-rickshaws is increasing at an alarming rate in Khulna. Because
of lack of any parking places, these auto-rickshaws create traffic jam in some points of the city (e.g.
Sonadanga crossing, boyar bazar more, PTI crossing, ferry ghat crossing, etc.). Clearly, these
easy bikes are friendlier to maintain the air quality of the city. But, no scientifically proven study
can be found on the actual energy consumption of these easy bikes. However, considering the
emerging situation, the consultant proposes the following•

Control the growth of illegal easy bikes (KCC provided licenses for 2000 easy bikes. In
reality, this number is much higher)

•

KCC should assign an specific color for these bikes

•

Battery driven rickshaws should be totally banned in the study area these rickshaws are
more accident prone. Moreover, these rickshaws creates confusion among other drivers
(rickshaws are usually slow moving vehicles, but these rickshaws are quite fast)

3.4.1.6

Bridge and Tunnel

The so far Khulna City is expanding northward along the Khulna-Jessore Highway. Such
elongated expansion raises the cost of infrastructure, travel time of the people and cost of travel.
There has not been any attempt to extend the city on the other side of the Bhiab-Rupsha, This
would enable economic and social integration of the settlements and establishments on the other
side of the river with the main city. For this purpose, DADP proposes to build 3 tunnels and 5
bridges on the Bhaiab-Rupsh at different places of the project area. Such high number of
bridges/tunnels are proposed on request by KDA.
At Noapara, a bridge can be developed near the present ferry ghat. A tunnel can also be
developed near the bridge or alternatively any of the two may be developed. In the main Khulna
City area, a bridge can be developed near the IWTA Ghat to connect Senhati area on the other
side. A tunnel may be developed near the Jailkahan Ferry Ghat. A bridge/tunnel can be attempted
in Khalishpur another at Rupsha Ghat area. Another bridge is proposed at Rob Sarani Ghat to
connect Dighalia area with the main city (please see Map-3.2). The use of helicopter is increasing
day by day for medical, matrimonial and other emergency purposes. But there is no helipad in
Khulna City. Expecting that use of helicopter will further increase in future DADP proposes to use
the divisional stadiums, circuit house ground etc. for this purpose.

Street Side Plantation

Street side plantation will serve two purposes, first, it will improve street view and city scape
aesthetics; second, this will become a source of ecological balance. Medium height short rooted
streets may be planted along the footpath beside the storm water drain. Consultant suggests that
the tree lines should be developed on both side of the carriage way. Tree selection should be
made carefully. Emphasis may be laid on ornamental trees than trees with wood value or fruit.
Ornamental trees producing flowers will be a source of street aesthetics.

Primary School

Usually, 6 to 10 year old children go to primary school and 11 to 15 year old juveniles go to high
school. Estimating from census data, it is found that 6 to 10 year old population constitutes
approximately 20% of the total population, while 11 to 15 year age group forms 14%. Using this
standard, it is estimated that of the total projected population of project area will be 16,52,854 by
the year 2023 and the number of primary school going children would be 3,30,571 while the
number of secondary school going population would be 2,31,400. Table-3.6 and Table-3.7 show
the demand estimation process for primary and secondary schools.

will accommodate 300 students. If two shifts are introduced in each year 2023.
school it will accommodate 600 students.
Total space required for 10 primary schools (@ 0.50 acre each) will be 5 acres.

Introduction of two shifts in every school and increase of students in each school will reduce the
number of schools. According to Ministry of Education, to establish a primary school, the standard
is 0.17 acre of land for each school. This amount of land is not enough to provide adequate space
for play area for children, which is essential for their physical and mental grow up. The Structure
Plan recommended larger space for schools to ensure playing area and recommended minimum
0.50 acre for each primary school. Accepting this standard, therefore, 10 new primary schools
would need of about 5 acres.
However, to avail the advantage of economies of agglomeration, many of the privately developed
schools are located in settlements creating highly skewed spatial distribution. That means, some
parts of the project area is well served with school and while the other remains unnerved.
Considering this situation, the consultant provided 22 primary schools with area same as
secondary school as a part of a package that includes a local play field and a local playground.

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

The consultant recommends that no school should be permitted on the rented houses except it is
in a high density area. Additionally, KDA should encourage the entrepreneurs to establish new
schools at the identified places in the long run to achieve a spatial balance between demand and
supply.
Location of primary schools have been selected based on following criteria,
•

location should be within the close proximity of the existing or proposed residential
areas;
• established structures must not be disturbed;
• it should be by existing or proposed road.
• preference should be given to locate it next to proposed park or play field.
In Appendix-3.1 a list of primary schools is given. Appendix-3.2 shows the location of local level
parks and play fields.
3.4.2.2

Secondary School

Master Plan 2001 proposed 800 students as standard for each secondary school and estimated
total 199 secondary schools for the Master Plan 2001 area for the year 2010. Although there was
sufficient number of schools already in the area, the plan provided 12 additional secondary
schools. These 12 schools can accommodate additional 84,000 students. It is estimated by the
consultant that by the year 2023 about 2,31,400 students will be studying in secondary schools, if
all the school going students go to school. The physical survey has identified 436 secondary
schools already existing in the project area. This number of schools will be able to accommodate
(436 x800) 3,48,800 students (@800 per school). So there will be no need for additional
secondary schools in the project area.
Table-3.7: Estimation of Secondary School for 2023

However, additional 12 secondary schools have been provided, because existing secondary
schools are not well distributed to serve all the residential agglomerations in a balanced way. In
both the cases, the primary and the secondary levels, private and NGO initiatives were not
considered. It was expected that considerable part of the requirement will be fulfilled by NGOs and
the private sector.
3.4.2.3 Other Education Facilities
As the number of colleges was sufficient according to standard, the Master Plan 2001 did not
suggest any space for new college, except one in Abhaynagar where there were no colleges. A
number of other education facilities were recommended by 2001 Master Plan at different parts of
the current project area as stated below:

DDC-DATEX

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

The Master Plan proposed a technical training centre (TTC) at Noapara on an area of
about 5.04 acres. A Religious Institute was recommended at Damodor over an area of
2.89 acres, under Fultala Upazila.

•
A new orphanage at Fultala was proposed on an area of 4 acres to accommodate about
200 orphans who can be trained on general and vocational education.
The DADP consultant feels that all the above proposals should be retained and developed as early
as possible. However, the consultant relocated these facilities to reduce project implementation
cost and avoid destruction of physical properties. Development all these facilities would help
reduce regional imbalance in education opportunities. Each secondary school will have an area of
approximately 1.65 acres. Depending on the urban settings and availability of vacant land, the
area may vary. A list of these educational facilities is provided at Table-3.9.
a. College
A new college has been proposed in Ward-07 of Noapara Paurashava on an area of 5.36 acres.
b. Technical Training Centre
A Technical Training Centre has been recommended also in Ward-07 of Noapara Paurashava
on an area of 5.05 acres.
c. Religious Institute
A Religious Institute will be set up in Damodor mouza of Fultatla Upazila on an area of 2.89 acres
d. School for Disabled
No statistics is available on the exact number of disabled population in the project area. However,
a study says that more than 46% of the extreme poor population is borne with some sort of
disabilities (source: http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/PDF/Outputs/EEP/Shiree-WP12.pdf accessed at January
26, 2014). This data shows the severity of the problem. Considering the situation, the consultant
proposes to establish three schools for the disabled kids on a total area of 5.76 acres. Please see
Table-3.8 for details.

However, for the sake of flexibility and feasibility of the selected sites for the selected usages, the
consultant proposes that the proposed sites for primary schools, secondary schools and collages
should be initially developed for their designated purposes, but in the long run, sites should be
allowed to be used for higher education facilities. This flexibility is essential for meeting the future
need which cannot be apprehended at this moment.

Location for Private University

There are two public universities close to the city. One is Khulna University and another one is
Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET). Apart from these two universities there
are Khulna Medical College, BL collage, Azam Khan Commerce Collage etc. as major education
facilities in the city. However, the number of private universities is increasing quite rapidly
nowadays. These universities are abruptly located mainly in the core areas of the city. Considering
the potential need for space to accommodate new private universities, DADP proposes three
locations on a total area of 51.58 acres details of which is shown in Table-3.9. Considering the
standard of 05 (five) acres per university, this area of land would facilitate establishment of 10 (ten)
universities within the project area which is expected to meet future demand of higher education.
KDA should pursue the existing private universities located within the city boundary to relocate
themselves to the proposed locations. Location of the education and health facilities are shown in
Map-3.4.

a.

2001 Master Plan Review

2001 Master Plan proposed two general hospitals each with 200 beds, one at Noapara and the
other at Labanchora, Khulna. The one at Noapara cover an area of 20 acres (8.18 ha) and
Labanchora proposed hospital covers 30 acres (12.14 ha). The plan proposed a 100 bed mental
hospital at Fultala area on a land of 38.59 acres (15.62 ha). A nurses training Institute was
proposed at Fultala on an area of 28 acres (11.34 ha). But none of these proposals have been
materialized.
b.

DADP Proposal

The DADP consultant feels that the health proposals made by the Master Plan are justified. As
none of these proposals could be implemented, it is recommended that the proposed health
facilities of 2001 Master Plan should be retained and implemented as early as possible. Due to
increasing population DADP adds one more general hospital to serve the central part of the project
area. Additionally, the consultant proposes to increase the capacity of the existing eye hospital to
250 beds. Three general hospitals have been proposed, one in Damodor mouza, Ward no. 04 of
Noapara and Jalma Union.
Apart from the same, a mental hospital is proposed at Damodor on an area of about 39 acre. A
nurses training institute is also proposed in Jugnipasha, Fultala on an area of about 28 acre.
DADP health proposals are presented in Table-3.10 and Map-3.4.

Fire Station

Master Plan 2001 proposed three fire stations at Durgapur Mouza (Noapara), west of weather
station near Khulna University and another one at Rupsha. Considering the current state of
development and growth potential, the consultant proposes changes in the locations of the 2001
Master Plan proposed fire stations and also adds two more fire stations (in total Three) Table-3.12
and Map-3.5. Arguments in favor of changing locations are (1) ensure maximum accessibility for
the vehicles of the fire services, (2) to bring maximum project area under the fire services
coverage.

Postal Service

Since preparation of Master Plan 2001, courier services has flourished significantly mainly
because of slow delivery of documents and goods by the national postal service due to inefficiency
and lack of confidence on the traditional postal system. Moreover, the emergence and popularity
of e-mail services has significantly reduced the burden on the postal system. However, the current
DADP proposes to establish one post office in each of the proposed town centers. The consultant
thinks that no space needs to be allocated for the courier services. Instead they should be placed
in the mixed use zone. This will ensure maximum accessibility for the public and also promote the
private initiatives for enhancing postal system.
d.

Central Eidgah

The Master Plan 2001 proposed to use the Boyra Divisional Stadium for Eid Prayers. But till today,
this proposal is not executed. The consultant supports the recommendations of the Master Plan,
2001 and also suggests some big play fields like the playground of Khulna University, Shahid
Hadis Park, and circuit house field to be used for Eid prayers held twice a year.
e.

Space for Security Services

Crime rate usually increases with the increase of urban population. Although three new thanas
have already been established namely, Harintana, Aarong-ghata and Labanchara thana. However,
thanas along cannot control the crime. The consultant recommends the metropolitan police to
prepare a comprehensive study on spatial distribution of the crime incidences (hotspots). And

establish police outposts at the strategic locations. Permanent, semi-permanent and temporary
structures can be built on the specified locations based on the type of crime of the hotspots.
f.

Mosque, Mandir and Church

The physical feature survey by the consultant shows that there are 35 churches, 923 mosques and
379 Mandirs in the project area, which means, one mosque for every 1400 Muslims, one Mandir
for every 500 Hindus and one church for every 30 Christians. This is far above of any planning
standard. Thus the consultant did not provide any more provision for Mosques, Mandirs and
Churches. Table-3.15 depicts the need assessment for different religious land use.
Driven by the religious beliefs, people are building mosques, Mandirs and churches without any
prior approval. Sometimes, these religious structures create external dis-economy for the
surrounding land uses (for example, the mosque at Gallamari is a major traffic obstacle in this
intersection). Considering this, the consultant suggests mandatory approval from KDA before
converting any land use to religious land use. Moreover, the consultant thinks that the mosque at
Gollamari should be relocated immediately to closest vicinity.
g. Bazar and Wholesale Market
i.
2001 Master Plan Review
According to 2001 Master Plan there were 29 bazars in the Master Plan area. By 2023, the project
area will need additional five bazars. However, the 2001 Master Plan proposed a total of 3 local
bazars. Some of these bazars fall outside of the current project area.
iii.
DADP Recommendations
Considering the changed situation, the consultant revises the 2001 Master Plan proposals. The
consultant also proposes to retain all other proposals of Master Plan 2001 related to evening and
holiday markets, wholesale markets. The proposed new retail markets in the project area stands at
04 including a fish market. These will be in Damodor, Ward no. 06 (Noapara), Naiharti and
Aranghata (Fish market). The current DADP also proposes three wholesale markets to serve the
existing local markets (Please see Map-3.5 and Table-3.13). Additionally, the consultant also
makes the following recommendations• No markets should be constructed or permitted on the major thoroughfare of the city.
•

For the existing bazars by the major thoroughfare, service roads need to be constructed to
ensure safety of the people and also to ensure free flow of traffic on the carriageway.

•

KCC should perform the main responsibility for developing these bazars. Some basic
utilities must be ensured in all the existing and proposed bazars. For example, toilet
facilities, electricity, water supply, drainage facilities, waste dumping stations etc.

•

KCC should also maintain the utility and services facilities regularly.

•

Proper design should be adopted to ensure airflow and sun in the bazars

Daycare Centre and Old Age Home

There is no daycare centre in Khulna City for working women with children. With the increasing
participation of women in the work force such facility would enable the working women to devote to
their work with more devotion free of anxiety for their children. Five daycare centres have been
proposed in the project area in the major employment generation centers. No precise locations or
areas are delineated for the day care centers because, day care centers can be located within a
building and it also does not require bigger land parcels. There is also absence of old age home in
Khulna. There are many old and helpless people in the society who have been either abandoned
or have nobody to take care of them live a distressed life. Old age home can help these senior
citizens in passing the last stage of the lives in peace and care. For this purpose, DADP proposed
three old age homes in different parts of the project area as shown in Table-3.14 and Map-3.6.

a.
2001 Master Plan Review
The 2001 Master Plan proposed two new graveyards (one at Moheshwar pasha and the other at
Sirajkathi in Noapara) with an area of 198.37 acres. But none of these graveyards was established.
b.

DADP Recommendations

Considering the standard of 2.5 acres of land for 50,000 populations, the project area would
require a total of 29.7 acres of land for graveyard and 3.48 acre land for Crematorium. According
to the physical feature survey, the project area is served with 149.31 acre land for graveyard,
Cemetery and Crematorium, which is more than enough for the project area. Table-3.15 shows
the space requirement for graveyard, Cemetery and Crematorium.

3.4.5 Sanitation: Public Toilet
a.

2001 Master Plan Review

The 2001 Master Plan did not propose any new public toilets to be constructed. However, it
informed that 15 public toilets were being built under Municipal Services Project at markets, bazars
and other important centers.
b.

DADP Recommendations

No precise standard is available about the requirement of the sanitation facilities. The consultant
proposes to retain all the proposals of Master Plan 2001. Apart from these proposals, the current
project also proposes the following Considering the poor public toilet facilities, the consultant proposes to construct toilet
facilities at,
 all major road intersections (where the local motorized and non-motorized vehicles stop or
wait to collect passengers) and bazar areas. The consultant proposes to construct four
units of latrines (two for male and two for female) and two units of urinals as a package.
For bazars and transport terminals, depending on the scale, number of this package may
vary. Locations of these packages should be such that, it serves all the stakeholders. A
sample design of public toilet is shown in Appendix-3.5.
 The consultants have identified some locations for construction of toilet facilities. No space
is allocated for these toilets. Location of proposed 21 toilets in Khulna City Corporation
area is presented in Table-3.17.

Following are some additional suggestionsi.

these toilets can be built by the KCC with financial and technical support from the
government and foreign development partners
ii. Toilet facilities for male and female should be separated such that the privacy is
maintained strictly.

Iii the toilets can be leased out to the private sector that will reduce the financial burden
on KCC at the same time it will help keeping these toilets clean and hygienic.
iv. Continuous water supply must be ensured by KCC. Overhead water tank can be built
up to ensure the same.
v. fecal sludge must be cleaned by KCC at least twice in every year.
•

Shopping centers and malls with more than 500 sq.m. floor space. The consultant
suggests to maintain the following standards for the shopping centers or malls –

Because of adverse climatic events, the project area may face severe pressure of rural
migrants. Thus it can be assumed that the number of floating populations will increase
significantly. The consultant proposes to construct bathing facilities at some specific places
where the concentration of these people is high. These bathing facilities can be tagged with
the previously prescribed package.

•

Many of the big ponds located in the project area are leased out for commercial use. These
ponds were previously used by the common people for bathing and washing cloths and
utensils. As their access to these ponds is restricted now, more pressure is created on the
supply water. The current DADP suggest preserving the natural water bodies over 0.40 acre
and keep them open for the public usages.

Open Space
2001 Master Plan Review

Khulna Master Plan 2001, in total, proposed 1970.70 acres of recreational and other green spaces
in the present project area. These comprise, park, play field, green space, urban forest, etc.
Among its proposals were two metropolitan parks, one playground/stadium, river front and road
side green and extension of existing zoo cum park. In total 197.70 acres (80.83 ha) of land was
proposed as park.
A sports complex was recommended at Gilatala mouza in Khanjahan Ali Thana, on an area of
about 50 acres. This was aimed to train the local youths in different games and sports to acquire
skill for participating in national and international competitions. However, lately a BKSP has been
developed by the City Bypass west of Khulna City. Therefore, this proposal may be withdrawn.
b.

Future Need Assessment

For providing open space recreation, the 2001 Master Plan recommended 2.71 acres of open
space for every 1000 population as the standard. But none of the open space proposals was
executed. The consultant believes that this standard is too ambitious and the development
authorities will not be able to preserve the open space according to this standard. The consultant,
therefore, thinks that the standard should be lowered. It is proposed to bring down the standard to
0.45 acres of open space for every 1000 population. According to this standard 798 acres of land
will be needed to be preserved as open space and recreation by the year 2023 for 16,62,294
populations. Currently, there exist 179 (72.47 ha) acres of recreational open space in the project
area. Therefore, additional 619 acres of open space of different categories will be needed to serve
the projected population of year 2023 of the project area.
c.

DADP Recommendation

DADP prepared a plan to provide parks at two levels, local level and metropolitan level. Local level
parks are provided zone wise. One park has been proposed for each planning zone. But in a few
zones, adequate vacant land is not available to provide park. In the same way, play field have
been provided for each zone. The zone, where free land is not available, provision of play field has
been avoided. Each park comprises minimum 5.12 acres, while the area of each play field
amounts to minimum 6 acres. In seven zones no park and play field have provided due to nonavailability of space.
Three metropolitan level parks have been provided Table-3.19. Almost all of these parks are
located in the south and south-western periphery of the project area. Other parts of the project
area are either not suitable for park or adequate space is not available. As the south and southwestern periphery are the most potential for future urbanization, emphasis has been given to those
areas.
Additionally, the consultant proposes to open up all the playgrounds located within school
premises to the local public after school hours. This will ensure greater access of the local people
to the open space.

135.83 acres gives a total open space as 757.24 acres. This satisfies the standard. A list of local
level parks and play fields has been provided in Appendix-3.3. and Map-3.8 shows the locations
of the proposed parks and playfields.

3.4.7 Rehabilitation Zone
If the DADP is implemented there will be some displacement of existing settlers. To rehabilitate the
evicted people and the land owners, the consultant has suggested an area of about 104.71 acres
as rehabilitation zone in three places as shown in Table-3.16. These locations are, Gutudia,
Naihati and Ward no. 01 (Noapara). Please see Table-3.16 and Map-3.7 for details.
3.4.8 Guide Wall, Embankment and River front Road
Guide wall have been recommended along the Bhairab river. A 54.40 km long protection
embankment is proposed along the Rupsha-Bhairab River. A road can also be developed on this
embankment to ease future traffic movement. Roads have been proposed on both sides of the
Mayur river. This is to attain two purposes- to stop river encroachment and to allow enjoyment of
the river site by visitors.
3.4.9 Town Centre Development
The town centre or city centre is the nerve point of activities of any urban area. Usually, town or
city centres develop spontaneously based on a market place, but they can also be created
deliberately to revitalize a city. 2001 Master Plan also made such an attempt to create some town
centres. But none of them was executed. In DADP, another attempt has been to create some new
urban centres discarding 2001 Master Plan proposals. A town centre will be provided with
commercial and cultural activities, shopping, games and sports, cultural and religious congregation
facilities. It will provide many urban services that are only available in the core parts of a city.
Because of close proximity of the Sundarbans, Khulna City can be the host city for tourists
providing accommodation and other services. This will create a symbiotic relationship between
Sundarbans and Khulna City. Considering this, the consultant proposes to establish tourist
information center and hotel facilities at each of the proposed town centers.
Town centres are justified on the following grounds:
a. They will provide functions to attract people;
b.

They will serve as the focal points for generating economic and social activities and will
thus decentralizing urban activities.

c.

Create of agglomeration of economic and social activities to promote local economy
through better interaction of buyers and sellers and help generate employment.

d.

Make some urban services and facilities better accessible to the fringe area people.

e.

As demonstration effect they will promote private sector developments in and around
town centre and will help grow settlements.

a. 1961 Master Plan Review
The Khulna Master Plan of 1961 also provided town centre in the plan for which 0.28% of the total
project area land was earmarked. The town centres were, Daultaltpur and Khulna.
b. 2001 Master Plan Review
2001 Master Plan earmarked space for 4 town centres within the current project area, with area
varying area from 8 acres to 40 acres depending on the potentiality of growth of the area. The plan

DDC-DATEX

3-45

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

altogether set aside 85.64 acres of land for town centres. But so far, none of these proposed town
centres have been executed. All these proposed town centres fall within the project area.
c. DADP Recommendation
i.

Hierarchy of Centres

Determination of hierarchy of existing centres within the project area is a cumbersome task. There
are two methods of determining the hierarchy of existing centres- from the size of population of the
administrative unit where the centre is located and for which population data is available, second
through survey of the type and number of existing service sector enterprises in the centre. The
prevailing centres in the project area do not maintain any specific administrative boundary for
which population data is available. The ToR does not keep provision for conducting any survey to
determine the hierarchy of existing centres. Therefore, the consultant is unable to determine the
same within the project area methodically.
From visual observation and experience, a number of existing centres of different sizes, within the
project area can be observed. Many centres are at the stage of emergence. Dak Bangla and the
surrounding area is the largest centre or CBD of the project area. The second largest is the
Daulatpur area, followed by highway corridor of Noapara. The smaller centres are, New market
area, Gallamari, Nirala intersection, Shib Bari Intersection, Rupsha Ghat area, etc.
iii.

Town Centre Development Proposal

The consultant proposed only four new town centres in the project area, and those have been
located in most potential areas. Since the town centres have not been proposed throughout the
project area the idea of maintaining hierarchy was found not necessary.
Discarding the town centre proposals set by the 2001 Master Plan, the consultant proposes some
new town centres considering their potentiality of the project area. Many town centres proposed in
2001 Master Plan were in rural areas that did not have the potentiality to develop as town centres.
So the number has been cut down to half in the DADP and the new town centres have been
placed on better places where there is better prospect of development. All the selected areas are
on the western periphery of the city. These locations are potential because the city, from Noapara
to Khulna will expand west. In total, four town centres have been proposed in the plan as stated in
Table-3.20.

of multifarious activities. The town centre site will have wide roads around for easy traffic
movement and parking. They will have good connectivity with the main city and places around the
sites. A detailed urban design will have to be prepared for this purpose. Map-3.9 shows the
locations of the town centers.
3.4.10 Hotel Zone and Tourist Information Centre
Two sits have been recommended as hotel zone. These are, one site is near Rupsha Khan Jahan
Ali Bridge under Noihati Union and the other in Mostofar More near Boyra. Both the places are
potential for city expansion. A total of 8.32 acre land has been allocated for this purpose.
Five places have been selected for setting up tourist information centre. These are, beside Bengal
Textile Mills in Noapara, suitablble place at Daulatpur, Sonadanga Bus Terminal, any place in Dak
Bangla Intersection, near Haque Super Market, Rupsha and Zero Point. Booths may be set up in
these places by Tourist Corporation in future to guide tourists coming for visiting Khulna City and
the surroundings.

SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT

a.

2001 Master Plan Review

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

The Master Plan recommendations about solid waste management were as follows:
•

Provide additional garbage truck (open/covered body), handcarts, communal bins, tractor
trailer, and incinerator. It also called for institutional development i.e. re-organization of the
solid waste management service for increasing efficiency through training on solid waste
management.
•

Introduction of door to door collection system all over the city and storing of solid waste in the
nearby dustbins placed at different locations on the basis of distance and households.

•

Creation of transfer stations and dumping sites.

•

Treatment of medical waste by classifying waste into two groups, hazardous and nonhazardous. Hazardous wastes should be treated by the Incinerator and then disposed off.
Hospital or clinic should have its own Incinerator or the City Corporation should have one or
more incinerators at different places to treat the hazardous medical waste on payment of
charges by the users. Non-hazardous wastes should be disposed of by the City Corporation.

•

In the face of expanding city, the plan proposed five new additional dumping sites e.g.
Rajbondh (beside the existing dumping site), Aronghata, Chachibunia, Phultala and Karnopur.

The plan also suggested a few scientific and hygienic methods for disposal of solid waste like,
controlled dumping system, sanitary land fill system, separation of clinical and hazardous waste
from normal waste, waste recycling.
To make solid waste management effective, the Master Plan recommended the following
measures:
•

Create separate solid waste management organization structure;

•

Procure new vehicles for waste collection;

•

Procure transport for supervision staff;

•

Ensure health and safety of workers engaged in waste collection and disposal operation;

•

Community participation and public awareness campaign;

•

Management privatization by awarding solid waste management services to
NGOs/CBOs;

•

Formulation of new legislation on solid waste management.

In the project area, Khulna City Corporation area is the main solid waste generator, where about
520 tons of solid waste is generated per day, of which, KCC can dispose of only 275 tons. There
are 155 transfer stations spread all over the City Corporation area, wherefrom waste is collected
by KCC for final disposal. This waste is carried in containers, trucks and other transports to the
dumping site at Rajbandh. The city Corporation has limited capacity to handle all the garbage
produced each day. Door to door collection system operates in 28 wards out of 31 KCC Wards.
The situation is similar in Noapara Paurashava. The separate disposal system for clinical waste no
more exists. Khulna City Corporation is currently executing a sanitary land fill project at Matha
Bahnga mouza of Batiaghata Upazila under Urban Public Health Sector Development, over an
area of about 25 acres. Another land fill project will be at Krishna Nagar Mouza near Gallamari

DDC-DATEX

3-49

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

over an area of 2.50 acres. The third will be developed at Rangpur Mouza of Dumuria Upazila on
an area of about 17 acres.
b. Future Assessment of Solid Waste
Master Plan set the standard of 0.50 kg solid waste generated by each person each day in urban
areas. Considering the projected population of 16,62,294 persons in the project area in 2023, the
total daily solid waste to be generated in the project area will be 8,31,147 kg or 811.47 tons.
c. DADP Recommendation
While KCC is unable to manage currently produced 520 tons of solid waste daily in the city, it
would be extremely difficult to manage over 900 tons of solid waste in 2023. Considering situations
of solid waste management in two urban local government areas, following recommendations are
made:
• Execute all the Master Plan proposals for solid waste management in KCC and in
Noapara Paurashava;
• Create effective door to door collection system involving local residents and increase
coverage;
• Create more transfer stations, both, in Noapara and in KCC area;
• Increase capacity of the urban local governments with financial resources, logistic and
manpower for better handling of increasing solid waste;
• Promote participation of private sector in solid waste management operations.
The capacity of KCC in handling waste has been increased since 2001. It has now 19 transfer
stations throughout the city. It is working on two dumping sites. But more effort is needed to face
the future challenge of solid waste management. Considering the future need, the consultant
proposes a new solid waste dumping site at Noapara Paurashava on 07 acres of land (DADP
Zone-01, Noapara mouza, Reference sheet number (1:3960 scale, grid-A13). Apart from this
proposal, the current DADP also proposes four new solid waste dumping sites considering the
spatial distribution of population and waste generation points. These sites have been placed in
such a way so that transport cost is reduced and without hampering the living environment of the
surrounding area. These sites should be used as flexibly as possible. Because potential impacts of
these sites on public health, water table etc. have is not done under this project. Area of influence
should not be taken as a rule of thumb of 500 meters. Based on the air flow direction, geological
condition, this area would vary. The consultant suggests establishing waste-processing facilities,
broad-based transportation facilities, urban forestry, grave yard etc. A list of these solid waste
dumping sites is given in Table-3.21 and Map-3.10.

DADP recommends that the following method solid waste management should be adopted in
Khulna for scientific and hygienic solid waste management. These methods were also
recommended by 2001 Khulna Master Plan.
• Controlled Dumping System
In controlled dumping method wastes are compacted in layers and covered regularly with 15 to 20
cm thick soil on top each layer of the wastes and finally closed up by a thick layer (1 m approx.) of
soil to control and reduce the, odor, breeding of flies rats, insects, etc., scavenger birds, animals,
rag-pickers/scavengers, smoke from fires, wind borne litter, and pollution of groundwater aquifers
/surface water by leachate/effluent seeping out of the wastes.
•

Sanitary Landfill System

As an alternative method of solid waste management the Master Plan suggested sanitary land fill.
In this method the wastes are spread and compacted in thin layers within small cells having a
maximum depth of 1.50 m. to 20 m. and comprising plastic membrane or water tight lining all
around the cells to prevent leachate (formed by leakage of rainwater into the wastes) from
polluting the surface water and ground water aquifer. Cells filled up with wastes are covered with a
layer of soil, which is spread uniformly and then compacted. Thickness of soil cover ranges from
15-20 cm. A final cover of about one-meter of soil is placed over the fills and compacted when the
filling reaches final or desired elevation to prevent burrowing of filled up wastes. The plan
recommended introducing ‘Sanitary landfill’ system as a pilot project in Khulna, before going for a
regular system.
•

Separate Clinical and Hazardous Wastes Management

The plan recommended handling clinical waste separately. It recommended installing ‘Incinerator’
which is the safest way to dispose of hospital and clinical wastes containing pathogenic bacteria
and harmful substances. Industries producing hazardous wastes should be treated by themselves
and disposed of these wastes safely without causing any environmental pollution and for this
purpose work should be coordinated with the Department of Environment.
It suggested installing a common or packaging type incinerator for disposing hazardous and
clinical wastes from hospitals and clinics and charging the beneficiaries to recover service charge.
•

Waste Recycling

Resources can be generated by separation of reusable and recyclable wastes e (e.g. glass, tin,
iron, aluminum, wood, papers, cans, plastic and rubber materials, etc.) at initial stage of primary

DDC-DATEX

3-51

and secondary collection points or at disposal sites. This method will accrue the following indirect
benefits:
•

it will generate source of income for poor rag-pickers/scavengers,

•

reusable/recyclable materials may be recovered which will reduce the volume of wastes
and extend the life of the disposal site,

•

vegetable waste may be composted in composting plant to produce manure for
agricultural firms and gardens,

•

Methane and carbon dioxide gases may be produced from the wastes and can be used
for local domestic cooking and heating purpose in small scale.

3.4.12 WATER SUPPLY
3.4.12.1 Khulna City Corporation
a.

2001 Master Plan Review

The Master Plan made the following recommendations about future water supply:

b.

•

The plan expected that extension of water supply through pipe system, public and
private hand tube wells within KCC area. It called for investigation on new groundwater
sources and potential surface water resources as future water supply system in and
around Khulna City e.g. exploration of potentialities of new sources of shallow and
deep aquifer, collection of surface water from river during monsoon season and transfer
to the Khulna City water supply system

•

Use of surface water from Beel Dakatia near Khulna City as a storage reservoir and
transfer to the Khulna City water supply system.

•

It was proposed to construct one Surface Water Treatment Plant using water resources
from rivers and storage reservoir/retention basin.

•

The plan proposed extracting sweet water from Majitkhali River and carries it up to
Gilatala across the river Bhairab and builds two treatment plants for supplying fresh
water to meet future water demand of the city.

•

It was proposed to build one retention basin at or near Alutala regulator. It expected to
release and re-circulate into the city water supply networks, the vast quantity of
drainage water through the regulator.

•

Explore potentialities of rainwater and its usage.

•

Creation of an independent body like Dhaka and Chittagong WASA with proper
organizational set-up to handle a sophisticated and highly technical work related to
water supply.

•

For extended area, the supply to be largely based on individual hand tube well for some
time. In case the density increases fast, a production well based network system can be
developed with the help of DPHE.

•

Noapara Paurashava was recommended to develop package type pipe water supply
system with production tube well.

•

Package type piped water supply system has also been proposed in Fultala and
Rupsha area considering them as growth centres, rapid growth of population and
expansion of Khulna City and demand for potable water.

•

Surface water Treatment Plant at Shiromoni, using surface water from the nearby rivers
was proposed, to treat the surface water and feed into the KCC water supply network.
Existing Condition Assessment

At present, the percentage water supply for Khulna is mainly from ground water source drawn from
both deep & shallow tube wells. The depth of shallow aquifers varies from 0 to 100 meters. The
deep aquifers are generally available from 150 to 300 meters. Shallow aquifers are recharged

DDC-DATEX

3-54

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

annually by rainfall and flood water at or near the point of abstraction. As future water supply policy,
therefore,
•

Present water supply in Khulna City is drawn from ground water, both shallow and deep
aquifers. The shallow aquifers are extended towards north and well developed to the west
of Dumuria. The depth of shallow aquifers varies from 0 to 100 meters, while water in
deep aquifers is available from 150m to 300m. In some places shallow aquifers show
salinity intrusion. Water from deep aquifers is better and drinkable. Arsenic concentration
in the ground water is below the admissible range. However, iron and manganese
concentration in some places exceed the admissible range. The deep aquifer ground
water resources in Khulna and its vicinity is very rich and potable. The area contains large
volume of ground water which is recharged annually. The recharge is estimated to be (a)
80 MLD plus an undermined deep ground water flux from west and (b) 159 MLD in
December 2010 (IWM Study as a part of ADB TA Project No. 7386). Both KWASA and
private owners of Tube wells shall keep the present abstraction flow in future.

•

KWASA shall take care of necessary facilities for necessary water resource development
to meet the future water demand

•

The Rupsha and the Bhairab are the two perennial rivers that supply surface water to the
project area. Salinity in the rivers increase during dry season. Rupsha has long been
subject to salinity intrusion, which is gradually penetrating deep into the inland threatening
the Bhairab. Survey points, around Khulna reveal chloride concentrations exceeding the
standard value of 100mg/l continuously up to the middle of June. In Rupsha the highest
Chloride (mg/l) was found 9,000 in April, 2010 and the lowest was 5,200 in the same
month of the year (JAICA Study Team Salinity Monitoring Result, 2010).

As long term policy to meet increasing water demand KWASA has undertaken a mega-water
supply project for Khulna at a cost of Tk. 25.58 billion. Under the project, water would be brought
to the Khulna City by pipe from the river Modhumoti at Mollahat. A water treatment plant would be
constructed with a capacity of 110 million liters per day at source. Besides, 11 water reservoirs
and 5 underground reservoirs would be constructed in different places of the city. About 750
kilometer distribution and connecting lines of different sizes would be installed. The project will
also connect 75,000 domestic subscribers. The project is expected to be completed by 2017.
"Khulna Water Supply Project" will cost of Tk. 25.58 billion, with Tk. 22.84 billion funded by JICA,
Tk. 52.3 million by ADB and remaining Tk. 7.5 billion would be provided by the government.

Future Need Assessment

KWASA estimated per capita domestic water demand for Khulna City in 2020 as 105 lpcd. Since
the DADP expires in 2023, we assume the per capita daily water consumption for that year as 106
lpcd. Considering this standard, the demand for water in Khulna City in 2023 is estimated to be
13.76 million liters per day for its projected population of 12,95,787.

DADP Recommendations
•

The water supply systems for Khulna City and adjoining areas should be from both
the sources: Ground water and Surface water. Development of both these sources
should be continued.

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

•

The Long Term Development Plan consisting of new surface water Treatment Plant
(capacity: 110 MLD) along with Intake at Mollarhat at Modhumati river, Impounding
reservoir, Raw & Treated water Transmission pipes which under implementation
with co-financing JICA, ADB and GoB should be completed as scheduled.

•

Long Term water supply Development should be planned to meet the water
demand beyond the year 2025 & for the year 2050.

•

Metering of all connections should be introduced as soon as possible to minimize
the water wastage.

•

Awareness Campaign should be carried out by KWASA, KCC to motivate people
not to waste drinking water.

•

As per estimation there will be a demand of 251 million litre in 2023. KWASA can
presently supply 102 million litre, and 110 million additional supplies will come from
the new project. These together will provide 212 million litre of water each day.
There will be a gap of about 39 million litre, which can be met by hand tube wells.
So the new surface water project will substantially solve water supply problem in the
city. Moreover, this will be a sustainable source of supply. It will also reduce
withdrawal of ground water leading to quick recharge of the water table.

•

Mayur River is the most important and the largest water reservoir in the city. It is
urgently needed that this resource is preserved for an alternative source of drinking
water, a breathing space and a place of recreation for the city dwellers. Appropriate
measures are necessary to prevent pollution and sedimentation of the river, apart
from encroachment by the riverside land owners.

•

With the continuous extraction of ground water, its storage will be in a vulnerable
state in future when the demand from increased population cannot be supported
with is only source. Because in all big cities the rate of extortion of ground water is
more than the rate at which it is extracted. As the run off area in the urban area
increases with the increased rate of urbanization, sufficient rain water cannot
penetrate into the aquifer to recharge it. Therefore, it wise to look for alternative
ways to meet increased water demand, instead of depending on ground water only.
This can to some extent reduce pressure on the ground water. In Dhaka it has
already been made mandatory to keep provision for rain water harvesting in high
rise apartments. Similar measure may also be taken for Khulna City. Provision for
rain water harvesting in apartments 10 storied may be made mandatory in Khulna.
This may be executed through incorporation of the provision in the 1996 Building
Construction Rules.

Noapara Paurashava Water Supply

3.4.12.2.1

Existing Water Supply Review

The source of Noapara Paurashava water supply is groundwater. The existing water supply
system consists of •

two production deep tube wells with submersible pumps one each at Bengal gate
with approximate specific yield 16 cubic meter per hour of each,

distribution of pipe line 13.5 km (200 mm dia: 0.558 km, 150 mm dia: 4.689 km, 150
mm dia: 8.245 km), 38 mm hand tube wells (HTW): 5200 nos. and deep tube well
(DTW) 76 nos. The piped water supply generally covers ward no 4, 5 and 6 only.

• Limited Coverage of Piped Water Supply and no overhead Tank in the system
3.4.12.2.2

Future Water Demand Assessment

Taking 100 lpcd as the standard domestic water consumption daily, in 2023 the total water
demand for Noapara’s projected population of 108 and 44 will be 10.80 million liters each day.
3.12.2.3 DADP Proposal for Improvement
Following are the recommendations for improvement of Noapara water supply:
•

Piped water supply should be extended to the most of the areas of Paurashava.

•

More production deep tube well, distribution pipe line & overhead tanks should be
provided to cater for future water demand.

3.4.13 DRAINAGE
3.4.13.1 2001 Khulna Master Plan Review
The Khulna Master Plan 2001 observes, about 68% of the household have no planned drainage
facilities in and around their premises and only 32% have some sort of drainage facilities. The
existing drains in KCC area discharging into the nearby Khals, rivers, low-lying areas and beels.
The road between Rupsha Bus Stand, embankment along the Rupsha at Shipyard and
Labonchora area serve as a town protection embankment which protects the eastern area of KCC
from river flood. BWDB constructed 6 regulators and 8 sluice gates and, one 10-vent sluice gates
located at Alutala which helps to drain out storm drain for KCC area.
The plan divided the entire KCC area into five drainage zones and identified nine water logging
areas were identified in the Master Plan. These are Natun Bazar, Rupsha, Tuatara, Shipyard
areas, East Bania Khamar, Boyra, RayerMohal, Khan-a-Sobur road (in front of KDA building),
Nodal point of Khan Jahan Ali & KDA Avenue (nearby and surrounding Royal Hotel).
The reasons of water logging as mentioned in the Master Plan are:
•

Improper operation & maintenance, and, blockage of Khals, drains,

•

Absence of integrated network comprising secondary and road-side drains,

•

Haphazard expansion of the regional settlements which obstructs the natural drainage
system,

•

Uncontrolled and haphazard disposal of solid waste into the drainage system,

•

Siltation in the drainage channels with consequent reduction of discharge capacity.

3.4.13.2 Major Recommendations of the 2001 Master Plan
•

Preparation of a comprehensive Drainage Master Plan for the city. This Master Plan should
include: survey of existing drain and culverts, assessment of extent and frequency of flood
damage to the flood affected areas, design of primary, secondary drains and retention areas
required, feasibility of the proposed drain works, planning of implementation phases including

DDC-DATEX

3-57

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

funding mechanisms for construction phases as well as operation & maintenance of the
system, and, selection of realistic return periods.
•

Taking mitigating measures against sulage flow, septic tank effluent and other locally
contaminated water through awareness campaign; provide better sanitation to low income
groups through construction of pit latrines, protection of outlet drains by providing oil and silt
trap, trash racks and sumps in some of the main drains.

•

Drainage system to be designed based on gravity flow & pumping should be avoided as far as
possible.

•

Future drainage system to be west wards and towards Khulna-Jessore drainage rehabilitation
project area.

•

Any proposed drainage improvement plan to be justified technically, economically & socially.
Priority program should be recommended for implementation.

•

Improvement in respect of solid waste management and household sanitation. KCC should
take immediate steps to remove the unauthorized structures like earthen barriers, small
culverts etc. from drainage paths/Khals and ensure clear right of way.

•

KCC should be the Implementing agency for drainage improvement project. A high degree of
close co-ordination with DPHE, BWDB, LGED and PDB and other utility organizations should
be maintained during project implementation stage. Cost of drainage improvement project
should be founded as grant to KCC or by Aid Giving Agency. Lay pipe drain where road is
narrow, and, where there is no space for road side drain.

•

The widths of some khals have been reduced due to rampant disposal of waste and
encroachment by khal side land owners. Surimarikhal and Motirkhal are the examples. The
responsibility of protecting these khals can be rest with KDA or KCC.

2001 Master Plan recommended for the preparation of a Comprehensive Drainage Master Plan for
KCC. It also mentioned about the existing drainage system, drainage problems, and made some
recommendations for its improvements. This Drainage Master Plan was prepared by KCC in 2011.
Some of the projects based on this Master Plan have already gone for implementation. Hope this
will solve many of the city’s drainage problems.
3.4.13.3 Existing Drainage System
Khulna City has developed in linear pattern running north – south and parallel to the BhairabRupsha Rivers running parallel to the main built-up areas. The city drains both to the east and the
west with the water shed being provided by railways embankment and Khan Jahan Ali road. On
the eastern side, a long narrow strip of land about 9 sq. km. drains directly into the Rupsha /
Bhairab River. The major part of the City, however drains westward into the Hatia / Mayur River
and Khudir Khal. The change in the elevation between the railway embankment and the Mayur
River is an average of 2 meter PWD above MSL.
The existing drainage system of Khulna City consists of major outlet channels such as Hatia
River, Mayur River, Khudir Khal, Rupsha / Bhairab River & 13 nos. link canals (Khals) such as
Charichara Khal, Motiakhali Khal, Khatrokhali Khal, Haringhata Khal, Tamuzuddin Khal, Nirala

DDC-DATEX

3-58

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

Khal, Mandar Khal, Taltala Khal, Batkamari Khal, Rayermohal Khal, Bastuhara Khal. The drainage
system also consists of nine control structures/Sluice gates such as Custom Ghat, Fish landing,
Rupsha Ghat, Matiakhali, Labonchora, Alutala.
The existing drainage network consists of about 1166 km drain of which about 1124 km is pucca
and 41.48 km katcha. Almost all of the pucca drains are made of reinforced concrete, and a few
are made of brick. The width of the drain varies from 0.50 m to 5 m and mostly from 0.50 to 1
meter. The existing drainage system is not adequate to meet the present need, and the drainage
coverage is low. It is only 57% of the city area.
3.4.13.4 Drainage Zone, Pattern of Drainage and its Problems in KCC Area
The 2011 Drainage Master Plan of Khulna City Corporation divided the whole KCC area into six
drainage zones based on topographical features, existing internal network of khals and river
system. The pattern of drainage and the drainage problems are illustrated below.
Zone-1: Long and Narrow Strip of Flat Highland along the Bhairab and Rupsha River
(Right Bank)
Drainage Zone-1 is a long and narrow strip of flat high land along the right bank of Bhairab and
Rupsha rivers stretching along north-west to south-east directions. This zone consists of core and
urbanized area containing 15 wards (2, 3-part, 5-part, 6-part, 7, 8, 9-part, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14-part,
15, 16-part, and 21). Total drainage area under this zone is about 12 sq.km.
Topography of this narrow strip can be described by elevation decreasing towards west and south
direction. The range of elevation in this zone lies between 4.2 m and 2.7 mPWD above MSL. The
drainage water is discharged into the adjacent rivers (Bhairab and Rupsha) through BWDB
sluices/regulators lying on the embankment cum road. General slope of the area is from east to
west and lateral slope is from north-west to south-west direction. Several Jute mills, other
industries, educational and residential areas are located in this zone.
Most of the areas of the zone are subject to flooding, particularly, Ward Nos. 7, 10, 11, 12 and 15
are mostly flooded during high tide and monsoon. The drainage coverage is only 40 % in Ward No.
2. Drainage coverage is in between 45% to 60% in other wards. Reasons of flooding are,
inadequate internal drainage, siltation of outlet drains/channel to the Bharab / Rupsha River, poor
maintenance of sluice gate. Due to these reasons, during high flood water from adjacent river
enters in this zone and causes flooding.
Zone-2: Western Central Part
This zone is on the central west part of the city with a total area of about 16 sq.km. This zone has
more pucca drains in the relatively urbanized eastern part, adjacent to Drainage Zone-1, while the
western part of this zone is low marshy land that covers Ward No. 4, 5, 6, 9, 14, 16 and 17.
Topography of this zone includes low lying areas with as low as low 0.3 m PWD above MSL to as
high as 3.6 m PWD above MSL. Drainage water is discharged into the Mayur River through some
khals. New Market, Boyra-Mohila College, Divisional Stadium and BDR camp are important
establishments in this drainage zone. This zone has large areas of flooding like, Deayana
Pashimpara in Ward No. 04, Choto Boyara and Rayer Mahal in Ward No. 16; Mujgunni Housing
and Bastuhara area in Ward No. 09 and western part of Ward No. 16 adjacent to the Mayur River.

DDC-DATEX

3-59

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

Bastohara khals located in this zone and is connected to Khude Khal via Pabla. This khal is being
silted up and gradually losing its capacity. Main reasons of flooding are siltation of major channels
such as, Khudiar Khal and the Mayur River and lack of drainage maintenance. Ward No. 16 has
only 40% drainage coverage, while Ward Nos. 5 and 6 have 55% and 50% drainage coverage
only.
Zone-3: North Western Part
Zone-3 consists of two Wards-Ward No. 1 and 3.This zone extends up to the Khulna City By-pass
road and comprises areas, like, Moheshwar Pasha, Telegati and part of Beel Dakatia.
Topography of this area can be described by consisting areas with elevation 3.90 m and 0.30 m as
highest and lowest zones. The area drains its water to Beel Dakatia through some canals. KUET,
Agricultural College, TT College, Mohsin College are the major establishments within this zone.
Area is 23 sq.km. Ward No. 1 and 3 are located in this zone. This zone comprises,
Maheswarpasha, Telegati and part of Beel Dakatia. These areas drain into Beel Dakatia through
local khals. The drainage problems of this zone are caused by siltation of existing khals, like,
Boroitala and local katcha drains. Drainage coverage is 35% and 60% in Ward No. 01 and 03
respectively.
Zone-4: South Central Part
This zone is located on the south of Zone-02 and covers one of the most urbanized areas of KCC
covering Ward No 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27. This Zone has a good network of pucca
drains. Elevation of this area varies between 2.7m to -1.2 m PWD above MSL. General slope of
the area is from north-east to south-west direction, which means, the drainage water ultimately
goes into the Mayur river through various drainage canals. Gross area of this zone is about 3.5
sq.km. Drainage water flows into Mayur River on the western through various drains and channels
such as Nirala Khal, Charichara Khal, etc.
This zone also has flooding problem during monsoon. Major flooding areas are, Gallamari in Ward
No. 24, Nodal point of Khan Jahan Ali Road and KDA Avenue (nearby and surroundings Royal
Hotel) Tutpara, West Tutpara, Tutpara, Monirbari khal par , East Bania Khamar. About 38% of the
households of the Ward No. 20 experiences short term water logging, though this ward is well
protected by embankment. Siltation of the Mayur River, outlet khals like, Nirala and Charichara
khals and others, blockage of out let channels and drains and improper maintenance are the main
reasons for flooding.
Zone-5: South-Eastern part
This zone is located on the southernmost part of KCC area. This zone accommodates important
establishments, like, Shipyards, Rupsha Bus Stand, Rupsha Bridge, City Corporation, Zila
Parishad, High Court, and Zila School. The zone has many pucca drains. Wards Nos. 21, 22, 23,
28, 29, 30 and 31 are located in this zone. Gross area of this zone is about 10 sq.km.
Elevation of this area is between 2.7 m and 0.5 m PWD above MSL. The general slope is from
north to south. Drains mainly discharge into the Rupsha River. This zone has some water logged
areas in Nuton Bazar, Rupsha and Toot Para.

DDC-DATEX

3-60

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

In this zone the primary drainage channels are not functioning properly due to siltation and
improper maintenance. The sluice gates are also not functioning properly due to poor maintenance.
Major flooding areas of this zone are, Natun Bazar, Rupsha, Bari Band area, Rupsha Shipyard
area, Labonchora. In Ward No. 30 and 31 about 94% of the households are affected by water
logging. During rainy season drain water cannot be discharged into the Rupsha River from most of
the areas of this zone due to the river water back flow. Back flow is caused by mal functioning of
sluice gates. Drainage coverage fairly good in this zone.
Zone-6: A Strip on the Western side of KCC (Extended Area)
This zone mostly covers the extended area of the project area. This zone is along the eastern side
of Khulna City By-pass road and mostly on the right side of the Mayur River and its branches.
Khulna University Engineering and Technology is a major establishment in this zone. Other areas
are Gilatala cantonment, Gilatala Zoo, Shiromoni Cable factory, Beel Dakatia Area. Part of
Bastuhara khal, Bil Pakkha, Taltala, Narikalbari Khal and Harintana khal are located in this area.
Most of the area is low and un-developed marshy or cultivated land. Elevation varies from 1.2 m to
0.3 m PWD above MSL. Gross area of the zone is about 14 sq.km.
This zone also has large water logged areas. The major drainage problems of the zone are, lack of
pucca drains, siltation and encroachments of natural khals.
3.4.13.5

Existing Natural Outlet Channels and Interlinked Canals

Natural drainage areas include marshes, water bodies, natural canals, beels, baors and other
selected undeveloped low lying areas. Some areas may be retained with little or no modification,
while the ecological condition of other natural areas may require considerable alteration. These
are Hatia river, Mayur river, Rupsha river, Bhairab river, Khudir Khal, Charichara Khal, Matiakhli
Khal, Shurimari Khal, Bagmara Khal, Mistiripara Khal, Tootpara Ghat Khal, North Khal, Harintana
Khal and Batkimari Khal, Khatrokhali Khal, Lobonchara 1 no. sluice gate Khal, Lobonchara 2 no.
sluice gate Khal, Nirala Khal, Taltola Khal, Bastohara Khal etc.
The Mayur River is one of the major outlet drainage channels through which a large volume of
water, both, from urban Khulna and adjacent Beelpabla and Beel Dakatia areas is discharged into
the river Rupsha. The Mayur River is the main drainage channel for the eastern part of Polder 28/2,
via a 10-vent sluice at Alutola. Moreover, a number of interlink outlet channels connect to this river.
So this river drains out excess water from most of the urban area as well as from the vulnerable
Beel Dakatia.
Most of the existing outlets& linked channels are not functioning properly. Significant portion of
these channels are encroached by the land grabbers. A full-fledged dredging, re-excavation and
bank lining are essential to continue the natural flow of the channels to open up them and serve
effectively as drainage channels and to meet the drainage needs of the area. Unplanned physical
development activities are causing encroachment on these water bodies, water courses and rural
drainage, reducing retention basins and the drainage capacity. Unplanned development activities
are also creating obstacles to natural drainage capacities of the existing khals and water bodies
causing long-lasting flood in inland areas and creating ecological imbalance. The peripheral water
level in the Rupsha-Bhairal is also one of the major causes of drainage congestion.

3.4.13.6 Water Logging/Flooding
The lack of the comprehensive and integrated approach to drainage and flood management in
Khulna City and the other urban area within the catchment area of the Rupsha–Mayur-HatiaBhairab river system has led to a large part of Khulna being susceptible to regular flooding. This
includes most of the built-up area in between the river of the Rupsha and Mayur including the
much of the commercial core and many of the residential area which experience regular and
extensive flooding during monsoon season.
Major inundated areas associated with drainage congestion are: Maheshwarpasa (Ward No. 03),
Deayna Paschim Para (Ward No. 04), Mujgunni Housing, Bastuhara (Ward No. 9), Choto-boyra,
Rayer Mahal (Ward No. 16), Natun Bazar, Rupsha Beribadh area (Ward No. 22), Gallamari (Ward
No. 24) nodal point of Khan Jahan Ali and KDA Avenue, Tutpara, West Tutpara, Tutpara Manir
Bari, Khan Para, East Baniakhamar (Ward No. 27), Rupsha Shipyard area, Labanchora (Ward No.
31), (KCC Drainage Master Plan, 2011).
Altogether some 70% of the city is identified as prone to flooding and 9% being flooded more than
10 times every year (STIFFPP-2). The Khulna Master Plan (KDA March, 2001) identified the entire
Khulna Sadar and large parts of Khalishpur Thana being prone to regular flooding with almost two
thirds of households having no proper drainage in and around their premises. 40% of slums
households experience severe or regular flooding.
The impact on Khulna’s drainage condition was assessed by the Study, “Adapting to Climate
Change strengthening the Climate Resilience of the Water Sector Infrastructure in Khulna
Bangladesh (ADB TA No. 7197 BAN, 2008)”. According to the assessment of the study, water
logging is expected to become more serious with climate change due to increased rainfall intensity
and increased out fall water levels causes by rising sea levels. As a first step in this study impacts
on Khulna’s drainage conditions were assessed by two assumptions: a) Future economic
development, b) No improvement in the drainage system.
According to this assessment, the water logging area with damaging water depth (higher than
30cm) increases from 29% and to 34% for the year 2030 and to 54% for the year 2050 for a 1 in
10 year flood event. The average water depth in the area of damaging floods increase for 41cm in
the base case to 49 cm in 2030 and 63cm in 2050 under the 1 in 10-year flood event.
Capacity and gravity of existing drainage channels are not sufficient to carry out the excessive
rainwater that usually occurs during the monsoon. Besides, inadequate drainage sections,
absence of inlets and outlets, absence of drainage outlets, lack of proper maintenance hampers
the natural flow of water. Water remains stagnant for long time on roads and built-up areas
creating water logging. Most of the katcha drains are close ended without any outlet. The reasons
for water-logging have been identified as following: (i) improper operation and maintenance of
khals/drains. (ii) blockage in the existing khal/drains, (iii) absence of integrated network comprising
secondary and roadside drains, (iv) haphazard expansion of the settlements which obstruct the
natural drainage system, (v) uncontrolled and haphazard disposal of solid waste into the drainage
system, (vi) siltation in the drainage channels with consequent reduction of discharge capacity. (vii)
Construction of structures in areas lowers that the peripheral water level. (viii) High water stages in
the outfall Rupsha especially during the monsoon.

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

3.4.13.7 DADP Recommendations
a.

Operation & Maintenance of Drainage System

KCC drainage maintenance is handicapped by difficulties in gaining access to major drains due to
large concrete slabs; lack of excavation of the major out flow canals; the poor condition of many
existing drainage; filling due to indiscriminate disposal of solid waste and limited institutional
capacity. The maintenance operation of drainage can be improved significantly undertaking the
following measures by KCC.
•

Enhancing the management and productivity of its current workforce.

•

Ensuring that material removed from drains is removed quickly.

•

Ensuring that collection from secondary solid wastes disposal sites do not result in rubbish
being left in the road.

•

Mobilizing local communities to participate in drain cleaning operations and reduce the
indiscriminate of solid waste.

b.

Awareness Programmme and Capacity Building

The awareness campaign should be carried out periodically by KCC to make residents understand
the,
importance of not dumping the solid waste in the drainage system;
not encroaching drainage channels/cannels areas.

•
•

KCC should undertake extensive motivational & educational campaigns that may include:

c.

•

Communication of awareness programs

•

Understanding the negative aspect and illegality of duping solid waste in & around the
drainage system.

•

Understand the negative aspect & illegality of encroachment of drainage channels.

•

The relevant approaches to be made to the residents regarding proper disposal of
solid waste (use existing door to door collection system).

•

The design of leaflets, pamphlets and other devices to ensure maximum impact to the
residents.

•

Periodical door to door campaigns with leaflets.

Capacity Building of KCC

Capacity building is needed in human resource, organizational development and institutional and
legal frame work. However, specifically the capacity building initiative for drainage may include:
•

Drain Survey and Mapping

•

Technical feasibility and implementation planning

•

Detail Design

•

Procurement & Contract management

•

Operation & Maintenance

•

Storage management

Completion of Ongoing Projects

The on-going drainage project, that is dredging, re-excavation of lining of major outlet channels,
link canals, re-construction, new construction and repairing of control structure, sluice gates and
drainage network (estimated cost: USD$ 27.726 million) and mostly financed by Asian
Development Bank should be completed as scheduled (by June 2016).
e.

Prevention of Khal Encroachment

One of the major problems of drainage system is encroachment and blockage of drainage
channels by the residents. All these activities should be dealt with severe action by the concerned
authority. All existing khals in the vicinity of the City should be preserved for future drainage. A
Committee named “Mayur Rakkha Committee” was formed to assess problem regarding illegal
encroachment of existing outlet drainage channels of link khals with specific proposals to mitigate
the problems of drainage. The Khulna City Corporation should take immediate necessary actions
to implement the suggestions in order to improve the present drainage system. KCC should also
take necessary actions to prevent dumping of solid waste in around drainage network.
f.

Door to Door Solid Waste Collection

Door to door collection of house hold solid waste should be improved and disposal of solid waste
should in sanitary landfill. This will discourage people disposing waste into the drains.
g.

Site Elevation

Building Control regulation should incorporate the condition to raise building site to minimum
allowable, plinth elevation, requirement of septic tank and soak pit to avoid flooding during
monsoon.
h. Execution of 2011 Drainage Master Plan
KCC should take effective steps to execute the drainage Master Plan it prepared. It should also
prepare a long term drainage improvement plan for the year 2050 to cater for drainage needs and
to reduce flooding.
3.4.13.8 Noapara Drainage
a.

Existing Situation

The Bhairab river, Amdanga Khal, Bhabadaha Khal, and the Railway borrow pits are the four
drainage discharge channels of Noapara Paurashava. Bhairab River is flowing from north-west to
south-east. The Amdanga Khal originating from Bhairab River outfalls into Bhahabata Beel. The
Bhabadaha khal starting from Beel Zickra outfall into Taka River. About 60% drainage discharge
from Noapara is directed to outfall into Bhairab River, 30% discharge into railway borrow pit and
10% discharge into Bhabadaha and Amdanga Khal. There are 8.54 km of existing drains out of

DDC-DATEX

3-65

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

hich 5.61 km is secondary and 2.93 km tertiary drains. There is no danger of flood water intrusion
into this Paurashava as ground level is higher than the high tide level of the Bhairab River.
The core area of Noapara Paurashava is slightly elevated. It is not generally affected by floods
from the adjacent river. But it is affected by rainfall runoff due to inability of the existing secondary
and tertiary drains to drain out the runoff efficiently. Due to inadequate drainage system some of
the areas are subjected to water logging during intensive rainfall in the monsoon periods. The
water logging areas are: Balia Danga, A.R. Cement Mill site, Himalaya Cement Mill site, Mokka
Cement Mill road site, Akterpur, Taltola, Sirajkathi, Noapara College area, Sorkhola, Sabujbag,
Sardarpara, Noapara Model Girls Primary School, Dhropadi, Laxmipur, Noapara main Bazar,
Kapasihati and Vangaget Bazar area.
The inundation spots are estimated to be of 725 ha. Depth of maximum inundation ranges from
0.50 to 0.55 meter and duration varies from 15 to 20 hours from place to place.
The following are the reasons for water logging:

b.

•

Absence of planned drainage system;

•

Absence of integrated network of secondary drains and road side drains;

•

Blocking in the existing drains with small discharge capacity;

•

Lack of timely operation and maintenance system;

•

Uncontrolled and haphazard disposal solid waste into drainage system; and

•

Construction of houses/infrastructures under the flood level.
Main Problems of the Existing Drainage System

Drainage facilities have not been provided with the growing urbanization and expansion of
Paurashava as per requirements. With increase of population, other additional infrastructures have
not been also provided. As a result, efficient and quick drainage of rainfall runoff into their outfall is
not taking place. The Bhairab River which collects runoff directly from a good number of drains is
influenced by high tide levels of this river. Tidal lockage will occur when the high tide levels in
Bhairab River are higher than water level of drains at their outfalls. Moreover, indiscriminate
disposal of all types of solid waste is minimizing the flow capacity of existing drains. The existing
tertiary drains and newly proposed primary, secondary and tertiary drains need to be planned and
constructed for efficient and quick discharge of storm water to the outfall.

Drainage Development Proposals

i.

Design Criteria & Approach

The existing drains are not adequate to drain out most of the areas particularly during monsoon
period. Hence, new constructions of tertiary and secondary drains are required to create an
integrated storm drainage system. The drainage system should be designed to handle the average
runoff for 1.1-year recurrence interval for tertiary drain and 2 years’ recurrence interval for
secondary drains.
The drainage channels should be designed to handle the average annual runoff from peak storms
with 100 mm free board for tertiary drain & 150 mm free board for secondary drain against

overtopping. Three types of drainage sections may be designed such as, lined brick work, lined
RCC and lined katcha drains.
ii.

Non Structural Measures

Noapara Paurashava should adopt some procedures and policies for efficient operation and
maintenance of drainage system to minimize water logging. The recommended non-structural
measures are presented below:

iii.

•

Paurashava should have adequate budget for operation & preventive drainage
maintenance program.

•

Existing legislation should be properly enforced in preventing unauthorized
development and encroachment in the drainage system.

•

Awareness campaign should be carried out to motivate people not to dispose of
house hold solid waste in & around drainage system.

•

Measures should be taken by the Paurashava and the district administration to
prevent unauthorized occupation, encroachment and filling of khals.

Improvement of Internal Drainage System

The existing drainage network may be improved and different parts of the Paurashava should be
linked into overall integrated drainage system. Hence adequate numbers of new drains are to be
constructed. The existing brick line drains and RCC drains suffer from long term neglect &
blockage. The existing drains should be incorporated into the proposed system to achieve a viable
drainage system for the Paurashava.
iv.

UGIIP Proposals for Drainage Improvement

Drainage improvements have been recommended in the Drainage Mater plan prepared for
Noapara under Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement Project (UGIIP) of LGED. The
improvement has been divided into the priority programs namely 1st Priority & 2nd Priority: 1st
Priority consist of a total 28.2 km drainage (primary: 1.56 km, Secondary: 27.95 km & Tertiary:
10.85 km) and estimated cost is: Tk. 121.57 million. The second priority work consists of
secondary drainage: 15.65 km with estimated cost: 59.95 million taka (Drainage Master Plan of
Noapara Paurashava, UGIIP).
Recommendations in the Detailed Area Plan are:
•

Paurashava should take immediate steps to implement the recommendations of
Drainage Master Plan that is to implement both 1st priority and 2nd priority of the
construction drainage system to reduce water logging.

•

Paurashava should take effective measures to carry out regular & preventive drainage
maintenance program for the proper functioning of the existing and proposed drainage
system. The Paurashava should have adequate fund, manpower & equipment’s.

•

Drainage integrated network’s connection to the outfall should be ensured.

•

Indiscriminate disposal of all types of solid waste which is minimizing the flow capacity
of existing drainage should be prevented by adequate and effective door to door
collection of solid waste and disposal to landfill.

DDC-DATEX

3-67

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

•

Community awareness campaign should be carried out to motivate the people not to
dispose of solid waste in to the drain & to make them understand the effect of this
(health hazard and water logging)

•

Construction of control structure/sluice gate to the outfall at Bhairab River should be
considered if flood water level of this river is higher than the invert elevation of drainage
of adjacent areas of Paurashava during monsoon period.

If all the recommendations are carried out, water logging of Noapara Paurashava will be minimized.
3.4.13.9

Extended Area Drainage

The Extended part of the project area is served by many tributaries and interlinked canal system.
These water courses carry the storm water runoff into the Rupsha-Kazibaccha River. Therefore,
the Extended Area is free from water logging. BWDB made a few flood protection embankments
on the western part of Khulna City. But as the upstream water has substantially reduced, these
embankments have virtually become redundant. Due to reduction in the flow of water, most rivers
and canals in the area have silted up. Many water course links have been cut creating lagoon like
water body. Many water retention areas, used for farming have turned redundant due to water
logging caused by siltation of outlet channels.
a. DADP Recommendation
1. All the existing rivers and khals in the Extended Area should be preserved from
encroachment and filling and unauthorized occupation.
2. There should be regular excavation of the natural drains that are subject to filling.
3. Roads, bridges and culvert development should be done carefully that they do not block
free flow of water through the khals.
3.4.14 URBAN AREA LAND MANAGEMENT
Past experiences visualize that urban development authorities like, KDA are not fully capable of
implementing any significant share of a development plan, not only for lack of resources but also
because they are not equipped with adequate institutional set up, including manpower, to
undertake huge development initiatives. As a result, urban infrastructure development always lags
behind the demand created over time. Sufficient development of infrastructure at appropriate
locations can foster urbanization bringing prosperity to the urban centre through more employment
and income. In view of the lack of response from public sector development agencies, only
through involvement of the private sector, that development in urban areas can be speeded up.
Upper level plans, in the past, made recommendations about various techniques of participatory
development involving the land owners.
2001 Master Plan Policies
The Structure Plan component of the Master Plan laid down some policies regarding urban area
land development, particularly relating to housing.
Structure Plan, in its housing part proposed the following policies relevant to housing area land
development.

DDC-DATEX

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

Policy - 01

the development authorities to play the role of facilitators of housing
development apart from their existing role.

Policy - 02

providing assistance to the government agencies in the development of
housing schemes.

Policy - 03

providing assistance to undertake housing schemes under the private
sector.

Policy - 05

providing necessary infrastructure to facilitate land and housing
development.

Policy - 06

planning interventions in the spontaneously developed areas.

Policy - 07

Promotion of participatory development process in the housing sector.

2001 Master Plan Proposal
Khulna Master Plan, regarding residential area development, proposed to adopt the techniques of
participatory development, like, Land Readjustment, Guided Land Development, various PublicPrivate Partnership approaches for residential area development to meet the growing demand for
residential space. But there is no evidence that KDA took any initiative in this regard following the
recommendations of the Master Plan. Since preparation of Khulna Master 2001, KDA did not
undertake any new residential area development. Lately, it has got a residential project approved
by the government. It took about 10 years to undertake a residential project, while its execution
might take another 8 to 10 years. However, in the meantime it did not take any promotional activity
regarding execution of participatory and public-private partnership land development techniques
recommended by the Master Plan. These non-land acquisition based area development
techniques could solve urban housing problems in a much better way by means of organized land
development including provision of all urban services with no money spent by KDA.
In the light of the policy recommendations of the Structure Plan, Master Plan made specific
recommendations about urban area land development as stated below.
•

From Provider to Facilitator

About this issue, in line with Structure Plan Policy, Master Plan (2nd tier) recommended KDA to
follow the principle of facilitator in housing development, instead of provider of housing. Bu so far,
KDA did not adhere to this policy or recommendation.
•

Public-Private Partnership

2001 Master Plan following Structure Plan policy, called KDA to promote programmes of publicprivate partnership in housing area development. The plan report proposed to facilitate housing
programmes of the private sector or private individuals under partnership development programme.
“This can be done,” the report said, “by helping the private formal sector in identifying, planning
and development of site and infrastructure for housing so that the private sector, apart from its
profit motive, can serve people with appropriate standard, specified in the Master Plan.” Thus,
before finalizing a housing project by any private sector developer, it may contact KDA for the
selection of site and seek its assistance for planning and approval. During approval KDA will see
whether the appropriate standards have been maintained in the project. KDA was also advised to

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

devise ways and means to realize infrastructure development costs from the beneficiaries. But no
step in this regard has been taken by KDA.
•

Development of Sites and Services Project for the Low-Income People

The 2001 Master Plan recommended to develop site and services projects for disadvantaged
groups. This was intended to help the low-income people who are not able to purchase serviced
plot from the private sector. It was recommended that KDA would develop site and services project
for the poor. It necessary, supply land at subsidized rate. It was proposed to design the lowincome housing areas in such a way so that the upper middle and middle-income households do
not show interest in such projects. These low-income housing sites can be developed near the
major employment centres from where the residents can easily commute to their respective work
places. The present 2001 Master Plan suggested several sites for such projects, such as in
Rupsha Ferry Ghat area (East), Labanchara, near Fulbari gate, and in Noapara. But KDA did not
undertake any such project to facilitate low income housing of the urban poor of Khulna City.
DADP Recommendations
Past experiences visualize that urban development authorities like, KDA, are not fully capable of
implementing any significant share of a development plan. Not only that they are constrained by
resources, but also because they are not equipped with adequate institutional set up, including
manpower, to undertake huge development initiatives. As a result urban infrastructure
development always lags behind the demand created over time. Sufficient development of
infrastructure at appropriate locations can foster urbanization bringing prosperity to the urban
centre through more employment and income. In view of the lack of response from public sector
development agencies, only through involvement of the private sector that development in urban
areas can be speeded up, particularly, in the fringe areas. There can be many ways of publicprivate partnership projects. Authorities should take initiatives to develop appropriate innovative
ideas of public-private partnership residential area and infrastructure development to expedite
urbanization.
Khulna Master Plan 2001, regarding area development, including residential areas, proposed to
undertake the techniques of participatory development, like, Land Readjustment, Guided Land
Development for residential area development to meet the growing demand for residential space.
But there is no evidence that KDA took any initiative in this regard following the recommendations
of the Master Plan. Since preparation of Khulna Master 2001, KDA did not undertake any new
residential area development. Lately, it has a residential project approved by the government at a
site recommended by the Master Plan 2001. It took about 10 years to undertake a residential
project, while its execution will take probably another 10 years, as the experience shows. However,
in the meantime it did not also take any promotional activity regarding execution of participatory
land techniques like, Land Readjustment and Guided Land Development. These non-land
acquisition based area development techniques could solve urban housing problems in a much
better way by means of organized land development including provision of all urban services with
no money spent by KDA. It did not undertake site and service projects for the poor, nor any
attempt was taken for execution of town centre development as recommended by Master Plan (2nd
tier).

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

Based on the current development experience, the consultant thinks that zero point area is going
to be the most congested area in the coming decade. If the development of this area cannot be
controlled at this moment, this area is going to be the most problematic zone of the study area.
This area is highly potential for future commercial dominated mixed development, because of the
intersection of two major highways (e.g. Khulna-Satkhira Road and Khulna by-pass), close
proximity to Khulna University and proposed Ahasanabad planned residential area. Considering
importance of the site, the consultant proposes an area with half kilometer radius to be
incorporated for future guided land development programmes. Some guidelines for development
of the zero point area have been provided in Appendix-3.5.
The proposals of the Khulna Master Plan 2001 were timely, rational and suit to the conditions of
the Khulna City. They are still valid proposals for future development of Khulna City. Consultant
strongly recommends executing the recommendations of the Khulna Master Plan 2001 regarding
urban land development.
3.4.15 CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ON KHULNA CITY
3.4.15.1

Urban Poverty in the Face of Climate Change

Climate change is a global phenomenon and its local impact is sometimes overrated. This is
because of inability of the climate models to predict the impact of climate change even for large
delta like Bangladesh. In a report of International Institute for Development and Environment,
Khulna is stated as one of the top three vulnerable cities in South Asia. It is also included in the top
13 vulnerable cities of the world due to climate change (IIED and CLACC 2009).
Because of climate change and climate variability, the vulnerability urban poor is increasing rapidly.
Although many literatures are available on the impact of climate change on the urban poverty, but
there is significant lack of the authentic scientific evidence. Nonetheless, a report of Brooks World
Poverty Institute divided the impact of climate change on the urban poor community into following
three types (Roy, Jahan et al. 2012).
Rapid-onset Events (floods, cyclones and catastrophic river erosion):
Often these kinds of events are more regional than local (urban). For example, severe cyclones
like Sidr and Aila. Several destruction of rural livelihood increases rural poverty. The result shortterm displacement and long-term migration to urban areas. The displaced households face a
drastic fall in their earnings; at the same time, they need more money to pay for basic needs in
urban areas. While men may quickly become engaged in some unskilled daily labourer jobs,
women find it harder to be economically active.
Slow onset event (e.g. coastal erosion, sea-level rise, salt-water intrusion, rising temperature,
changing rainfall patterns and drought)
Soil and water salinity is shattering rural ecological footprint aggravating the rural poverty situation.
Because of shrinkage in supply of traditional building materials (bamboo and golpata) due to
climate change, numerous people were forced to change their profession engaged in construction
of traditional dwellings. Health issues because of increasing heat stress (sleeplessness and

DDC-DATEX

3-71

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

difficulty at work, respiratory diseases, gastro-intestinal problems and fatigue) and severity of cold
waves (cold and flu, and respiratory diseases) are increasing significantly.
Cascade effect
This effect implies a chain of events due to an act affecting a system, such as environmental
degradation, increased urbanisation, reduced human security and local and international migration.
In Khulna it is one of the major reasons for widespread urban poverty. This urban disadvantaged
people are forced to live in slums and squatters in a degraded human condition.
Because of climate change, Khulna City would face multifaceted problems. Climate variability
would disturb the traditional livelihood pattern of the rural people. This may result Khulna City to
become the destination of large scale climate refugees. This would create pressure on the existing
job bank, number of slums and squatters would increase leading to deterioration of law and order
situation. To minimize the adverse impact, DADP proposes the following-

3.5

•

Informal economic activities must be promoted to create employment for the unskilled
labour forces.

•

Slum Improvement projects (SIPs) should be bolstered to ensure healthy living
environment for the poor.

•

To tackle the temporary unemployment and underemployment crisis of the poor people,
microcredit facilities should be made more poor friendly.

•

Road arboriculture should be promoted to minimize the heat island effect in the city. At the
same time, use of heat absorbing and reflective materials should be discouraged for
building construction.

•

Roof top gardening should be promoted along with the use of solar panel as a source of
green energy.

LAND USE REVISION
3.5.1 Criticality of Land Use Revision
There has not been expected economic growth in Khulna City since 2001 and hence the spatial
development of various land uses proposed in 2001 Master Plan remained unimplemented. The
recent land use survey by the consultant shows commercial land use as 0.74% of the study area,
but Master Plan 2001 projected the commercial land use as 1.09% of the study area to be
developed by 2010. Such discrepancies will be wide spread in case of other land uses as well. So,
it is necessary that 2001 Master Plan (2nd tier) land use zoning should be revised as already 10
years have elapsed after preparation of the Master Plan. Terms of Reference (ToR) also call for
revision of the 2001 Master Plan land use provisions. But there is one major problem with such
revision. KDA has already approved many building plans based on 2001 Master Plan land use
zoning. So, it might create a problem in maintaining consistency with the previous zoning if any
major change is brought about in existing land use zoning. Consultant feels that any change in the
zoning should be carefully decided. Before reaching to any decision to change, it should be
carefully looked upon if there will be any inconvenience or side effect of the decision to the existing
building owners and the plan approving authority. Again, any unwanted change may also lead to

DDC-DATEX

3-72

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

detrimental environmental consequences to residential areas already developed as per previous
zoning plan. Another problem might arise regarding keeping consistency of the project area land
use with the of the 2001 Master Plan area adjacent to the project area.
3.5.2 Review of 2001 Master Plan Land Use Provision
Before embarking on revision of the existing zoning, it is necessary to have a closer look into the
2001 Master Plan zoning provisions. 2001 Master Plan divided the entire Master Plan (2nd tier)
area into 17 land use zones in order to streamline and organize spatial development. The highest
amount of land was allotted for residential purpose. Apart from marking existing residential areas
the plan also delineated under residential land use, those agricultural areas which offered the
greatest possibility of spatial growth in future. Residential areas were also proposed to
accommodate certain ancillary services for the sustenance of the residents. Mixed land use was
allotted to those areas that were most potential for quick spatial growth. The important reason
behind mixed use was to ease building plan approval. Among other major land uses, the plan
proposed 1311 acres as mixed use Appendix-3.3.
Apart from existing commercial areas, the 2001 Master Plan marked new commercial areas in
those places where possibilities of commercial growth were assumed greater. These include city
centres and adjacent area, proposed major road intersections, town centres, established market
places. A total area of 2,225.41 acres (3.86%) was earmarked for commercial use inclusive of
existing commercial areas.
Khulna already has a number of established industrial agglomerations, apart from those, the plan
marked new industrial sites at Labanchara, Rupsha, Dighalia and Noapara. A total of 3,032.57
acres (6.77%) was proposed as industrial land use in the plan including the existing ones.
The Master Plan proposed 23,679.53 acres as residential land use which was 52.87% of the total
planning area. About 872.26 acres (1.95%) was proposed for open space and urban green that
include park and play ground, roadside and riverside greenery.
For existing large areas of land under storage and warehouse, a new land use was created
encompassing 125 acres. For existing and future public administration, an area of 769.26 acres
was earmarked in the central areas of the city (See Appendix-3.3.).
Education facilities for various levels are scattered all over the Master Plan area. The plan
recommended about 1,087.92 acres for this category that include 287.92 acres of additional lands
for new education facilities. Area for health facilities proposed by the plan covers an area of about
307.43 acres with 140.17 acres of additional land for new facilities (See Appendix-3.3.).
Municipal and community land use covers all categories of existing facilities and establishments of
public use, like, utility services installations, religious establishments, indoor recreational facilities,
etc. The proposed land for this category including existing facilities is about 87.50 acres (See
Appendix-3.3.).
Transportation land use includes roads, railway alignments, transport terminals and stations, etc.
The plan estimated as 4,664.30 acres (8.15%) under this category including existing facilities.
There are some large defense and security establishments of Army, BDR, and Police that cover

DDC-DATEX

3-73

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

about 425.42 acres. All these facilities have been marked under defense and security. The plan
earmarked about 239 acres of land for graveyard in Khulna and Noapara (See Appendix-3.3.).
The existing large brick field areas around the city were marked under brick field category with an
area of about 512 acres. There exist scattered fish farms within the city environs. The plan marked
under fish farm an area of about 439 acres.
Water bodies within the 2001 Master Plan area cover all categories of ponds, khals, water
channels except rivers, beels, etc. The total land under this category has been found 656.05 acres.
Over three fourths of the existing agricultural land went to various proposed urban use. Remaining
land (18.30%) was put under agricultural use with an estimated area of 29,884.80 acres.
Please refer to Table-2.2 and Chapter-2, where comparison of 2001 Master Plan survey (1998)
and current survey (2012) have been provided. It shows that agricultural land has reduced by
about 40.41% in last 14 years, which indicates that other urban land use has grown occupying
agricultural land. The current survey found commercial land use increase by 56%, but it failed to
achieve the objective of 2001 Master Plan target of 119.20%. Similarly, the 2001 Master Plan
projected 2707 acres of land for industrial use. But the consultant (2012) found 1125 acres as
industrial land use, which is significantly below the proposed land use for industries. This also is an
indication of the sloppy condition of the local economy. On the contrary residential area increased
significantly, which implies that urban areas are expanding with very low density. However,
projected mixed land use was very close to the existing figure. But commercial land use failed to
reach target by large margin, which is the indication of poor performance of the local economy of
Khulna.
3.5.3 Recommended Land Use
Despite land use provisions of 2001 Master Plan, there have been huge developments in the
informal sector within the Master Plan area ignoring the land use zoning. It is hardly within the
capacity of KDA to impose control on these unruly developments. Considering this reality, the
current plan during its land use review accommodates almost all the land uses that developed
deviating the 2001 Master Plan land use provision. However, in many cases, changes have
initiated considering potentiality of the areas in particular land use development. The revision of
land use has been made based on current land use survey and review of the 2001 Master Plan
land use. The consultant has made utmost efforts to maintain the land use standard as much as
possible. However, because of the congested built up environment and sprawl, standards cannot
be achieved for all land uses.
3.5.4 Restructuring of Proposed Land Use
DADP makes a revised land use provision under the current project to replace the land use
zoning provision made in the 2001 Master Plan. The land use zoning is intended for three
purposes:
•

development control;

•

preserve environmental quality and;

•

to preserve the urban land price.

DDC-DATEX

3-74

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

The new land use re-structuring have been done on review of the 2001 Master Plan land use
and the land use survey done in 2012 under the current DADP Project. In the 2001 Master
Plan there were 17 categories of land uses. The land use survey (2012) categorized land
uses into 18 classes.
The 2001 Master Plan land use classification was intended to delineate the future land use of
the Master Plan area, while DADP land use survey was done to assess the current land use
of the study area. In the proposed land use zoning of DADP, the consultant has brought
down the land use categories to 12. This is shown in Table-3.23. The re-structuring has been
done in the following manner.
In the existing landuse survey, there ar` e two transport related classes, Circulation Network
and Transport and Communication. They are actually, vey related land uses. So, both have
been merged to make a single class called Transport. There are three similar classes called,
Community Service, Non-government services and Service Activity. They have been merged
as Service Activity. Urban Green, Recreation including Park, Play Field and Stadium have
been merged and renamed as Recreation and Open Space. Miscellaneous land use has
been merged into Mixed Use. They are very similar land uses. The consultant feels that
merging them together will make land use clearance and development control easier, both for
KDA and for the permission seekers.
The existing survey map has identified abnormally high number of ponds. Data of other
waterbodies (Khals for example) has also shown abnormal growth. The consultant proposes
to preserve all water bodies including ponds and ditches with more than 0.40 acre. This is
because (1) these water bodies would act as the retention pond and (2) importance of these
water bodies as carbon absorber cannot be overlooked. The smaller water bodies would
serve the purpose of urbanization. Thus, with the increasing densification of the urban areas,
these ponds will be lost. However, other than the water bodies shown in the CS/RS mouza,
all other water bodies are deleted from the proposed database as it was demanded by KDA.
3.5.5 Future Requirement of Land for Selected Uses
From the discussion in Section 3.5.3, it is evident that the city failed to meet the expectations of
2001 Master Plan by large margin in most cases. In one hand, residential land uses expanded with
very low density, on the other hand commercial and industrial land use failed to stand up to the
expectation of 2001 Master Plan. From urban planning’s point of view, both are indication of
several kinds of problems. The current DADP further attempts to identify land requirement for the
year 2023.
a.

Residential Land Use

In 2001, the population density was 75 ppa. Projection of population for 2012 shows density as 97
ppa, which means 22 ppa has increased over 11 years that is each year increase of 2 ppa. If the
increase follows the same trend, then by the year 2023, the density would be 119 ppa. More
optimistically we can assume that by 2023 the density would be 150 ppa.
Under this assumption the projected 16,52,854 populations for the project area would need
11,019.03 acres of land for residential purpose. But survey by the consultant (2012) reveals that

DDC-DATEX

3-75

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

the project area already has 16,549.05 acres’ land under residential use including the rural
homestead. So, there is no additional land need to be provided for residential use. However,
considering the future growth potential of the city, the consultants generously proposed extension
of residential land use to 23,119.55 acre. With this extension, the consultant also proposes the
following restrictions on the land uses:

1. No extension of residential use should be allowed outside the project area.
2. Agricultural area and water bodies should be declared as development protected areas as
soon as possible.
Considering the poor and very congested residential condition, the consultant proposes a total of
13.73 acre land to be allocated for low-cost housing [(DADP zone 25, Naihati mouza, Reference
sheet no. (1:3960 scale), J03]. A detail of this low-cost housing area is provided at Chapter-5.
Additionally, the consultant allocated 139.57 acre land for development of planned residential area
at Jalma union [DADP Zone 21, Reference sheet (1:3960 scale) no H02] to be developed by KDA
after finishing the on-going Ahsanabad residential area project.
b.

Commercial and Manufacturing Processing Land Use

Future requirement of commercial and land for manufacturing and processing is dependent on
future economic activities. There are many factors that determine the growth of future economic
activities. But how these factors will perform in future is extremely difficult to predict. The factors
that dominate most are the economic growth, the number of employment likely to be created, the
number population likely to migrate to the city due to poverty and unemployment in the country
side. These factors are again dependent on many socio-economic conditions. Since these
conditions cannot be controlled by any means, it is very difficult to make a precise projection of
future requirement of commercial and land for manufacturing and processing land. Then how to
determine future commercial land requirement? To solve this problem, we have devised a simple
thumb rule of commercial land allocation based on proportion of population.

494.69 acres(Adding 10% to 449.72 acres)

Source: Analysis derived by Consultants

In 2013, the estimated study area population was 13,65,805, while the land under commercial use
during the same period, found by field survey was 424.89 acres.
If we consider the same proportion of land will be needed in 2023 for commercial purpose, then for
its projected population of 16,52,854, the proportion of land comes to 449.72 acres. The consultant
feels that with the development of Padma Bridge and Railway communication with Mongla, there
will be increase in economic activities that will lead to increase in the purchasing power of the

DDC-DATEX

3-76

Final Planning Report

Chapter 3: Detailed Area Development Plan

people. Therefore, there will be need of additional land for commercial use. The consultant,
therefore, proposes additional 10% increase in the estimated proportionate land for the year 2023.
This gives 494.69 acres as land requirement for commercial land use in 2023. In reality, the
consultant proposes only 491.24 acres of land for absolute commercial use. Because the
consultant feels that (1) these is ample scope of densification of the existing commercial land use,
and (2) commercial use will have scope of development within mixed use. It is to be noted here
that the consultant proposed 4,736.08 acres of additional land for mixed use which will be mainly
dominated by residential and commercial use. In the same way, manufacturing and processing
land use for 2023 have been determined as 3,032.57 acres.
b.

Education and Research

The plan provided 22 new primary schools on an area of 40.61 acres. These primary schools are
proposed as a package with Local Park and playground. The consultant suggests that these
schools will become secondary schools by the end of this project period. Considering this, all
these schools are allocated an area of about 1.65 acre (same as the secondary schools).
Twelve secondary schools have been provided on an area of 20.25 acres. One college at
Sirajkathi takes 5.36 acres, a Technical Training Institute at Sirajkathi on an area of 5.05 acres and
