5.1.1 Sector: Housing
5.1.1.1

Sub-sector: Low Cost Housing

Project Title : Low Cost Housing for the Urban Poor at Bagmara Mouza
Project Components
Background of the Project

Description
Khulna City is one of the urban poverty pockets of Bangladesh. The 2001
Structure Plan report identified about 7% of the city’s households not having
proper housing. One study report identified more than 520 slums and
squatters in Khulna City. On an average, each of the household living in
slums and squatters uses only about 400 square feet area, which is very
small compared to their need.
According to the 2001 Khulna Master Plan (Vol. III, p. 30) one third of the
city’s households live in poverty. According to the same report, during late
nineties, about 18% of the City’s population lived in slums and squatters.
Rest of the households lived in the mixed use areas. 2001 Khulna Master
Plan identified 172 small and large slums in the city that were inhabited by
about 80,000 people. On the other hand, Angeles et.al. (2009) stated that
about 20 percent of the total population of Khulna City lives in 520 lowincome communities. Considering the negative impact of the climate change
and climate variability, natural disaster, etc. the number of poor in the city is
expected to rise in future. This will increase pressure on existing housing
stock of the urban poor people. This housing project will address housing the
need of the poor and thus certainly relieve the pressure for poor housing to
some extent.
Recommendation of Khulna The 2001 Structure Plan part of the Master Plan made some key
Master Plan 2001
recommendations regarding the urban poor settlements. These are,

The project will provide planned residential area with decent and
uncongested living environment, improved drainage and sanitation, open
space, etc., which in turn will create very positive impact on the lives of the
poor living in this neighborhood. Through ensuring descent habitation, this
project will protect urban ecological footprint. If these poor people are not
accommodated at this place, they will be indiscriminately settle in different
unhealthy places of the city, shattering the social togetherness, creating
negative impact on the land use. The project will cause positive impact on the
environment as the area has been designed with all social services and in a
planned manner.
The project will help to improve the living condition of the poor people
especially of the children. It will also ensure better quality of life of the poor.
Tenure security will raise community feelings and belongingness ensuring
social security and social safety for the women and children.
The project will provide shelter to urban poor with community based
employment generation. Because of the proximity of the city and Boro-bazar,
marketing of cottage and small industry based products will be closer as
employment sources. The project site is also located very close to
Labanchara industrial area. DADP has also marked large areas in Rupsha
for industrial development. This will act as a potential employment hub for the
residents of the project area and reduce their transport cost to employment
centres. Additionally, the project will reduce the cost of accommodation with
additional benefits of providing healthy living environment and save them
from vulnerability of diseases. This will raise their productivity and will help
the poor people to escape from the clutches of poverty. Through ensuring
healthy living environment the project will ensure healthy and happy life that
will have positive feedback on the economic and social conditions of the poor
residents.

5.1.2 Sector: Infrastructure
5.1.2.1 Sub-sector :Solid Waste Management
Project Title: Solid Waste Recycling for Resource Generation and Waste Disposal : Composting from Organic
Waste
Project Components
Background of the Project

Objective of the Project

Description of the Project

About 700 tons of solid waste is generated in Khulna City currently every day.
In 2023 this will reach about 850 tons. Only about half of this waste can be
presently disposed, the rest is littered around the city.
Waste is a great problem for local environment as it pollutes the living
environment endangering public health. However, with proper management
substantial part of this huge solid waste can be converted into resource with
economic value. At the same time, it is possible to protect local environmental
quality. The organic component of the waste, that comes mainly from the
kitchen, can be converted into compost that have economic value. The compost
can also meet the local demand for fertilizer. The plant will produce about 75
tons of compost each day after full implementation of the project.
- To protect livable environment.
- To produce resource out of waste.
- To make proper management of solid waste.
A compost plant will be installed at any suitable place within the project area. An
organic part of the city’s solid waste will be dumped at the project site. The
waste will be sorted out to collect required organic waste for processing. The
residue will be used for other purposes including land filling. The organic waste
will be processed into compost through decomposition. The processed compost
will be bagged and marketed. The project will produce a handsome amount of
profit over cost of production.
Following is the process of composting:

DDC-DATEX

Waste will be screened to separate large inorganic items, such as, tire,
glass, plastic bag, tube light, polythene, metal scrap, and non-degradable
materials.
The screened waste will be sprayed with composting bio-culture at the rate
of 1 litre per ton of waste.
The waste will be arranged in heaps each day.
Each heal of waste will be turned once in a week for even distribution of
composting micro-organisms.
This process will continue for 45 days, after which the waste will turn into
black looking compost.
In case the compost is wet, it will be spread out to get them dried.
After the compost is adequately dry, it will be screened again to trace the
remaining degradable materials with the help of separation machine.
The compost will be passed through milling machine that will reduce the
compost grains to uniform size.
After testing, if it is found that the compost lacks quality, extra nutrients may
be added.
After milling the compost will bagged and made ready for marketing.
The process will produce some residue after screening that can be sold in
the scrap market to earn extra revenue.

Sub-sector: Road Infrastructure

Project Title

Service Road Development Along Khulna City Bypass

Background of the Project

Movement in highways in Bangladesh is cumbersome, not only that there are
physical obstacles on highways for smooth vehicular movement, but there are
also admixture of traffic on the highway affecting its effective functionality.
Movement of fast and slow moving traffic on the same road often interrupts
movement of high speed motor vehicles. Another disturbing element is the short
distance moving local traffic.
When settlements including commercial and industrial developments, occur
along the highway, the traffic generated from the land uses adjacent to the
highway also use the highway. This local traffic moving at short distances
disturbs the fast moving highway traffic and delays their movement. This delay,
finally, leads to national economic loss. If the highways can be kept free for high
speed vehicles only, this delay can be overcome. Since, due to lack of resources
government is unable to build alternative roads for slow moving and local
vehicles, we must look for alternative ways to separate high and slow moving
traffic in the same highway. This project is an attempt to create separate path for
local and slow moving vehicles in the road space to allow free movement of high
speed traffic in the highway.

Description of the Project

Objective of the Project

The existing City Bypass on the western periphery of Khulna City has a right of
way of about 150 feet. But the actual highway, currently, takes only about 50
feet. The rest of the right of way is unutilized. Two physically separated lanes
can be developed on two sides of the highway. These will be service roads
serving the slow moving and local traffic only. Besides, the new lanes will be
physically separated from the main highway to discourage traffic from the service
lanes to enter the main highway. Entry points to and from the highway will be at
intersections only. Where the intersections are at longer distance, entry points
will be created at every 3 kms. If there are too many intersections, only major
intersections not less than a kilometer will be allowed for entry and exit. Initially, it
will be pilot project. If found successful, it can be replicated in other sections of
the highway.
- To allow free flow of traffic on the highway;
- To reduce economic loss due to traffic delay on highway.

Implementing Authority

The project will be implemented by the Roads and Highways Department

Feasibility

Location and Length: The project will be implemented from Zero point upto
Rupsha Bridge. The distance of the roads will be 12.52 km with 6.26 km on each
side.
Land Price: The land is owned by RHD, so no extra fund will be required for
land acquisition.

Typical Service Road Design

DDC-DATEX

Two 7.5 m service road will be built (including shoulder) on both sides of the
highway.The service road will be designed contiguous to the existing highway,
creating dividers on both sides. The dividers will physically separate the main
highway from the service roads. Figure-5.1 shows the design of the Service
Roads in City Bypass and Figure-5.2 shows the service Road Design in Rupsha
Bridge Approach Road.

Land requirement

No additional land will be required as the entire land belongs to the Roads and
Highways Department (RHD).

Impact assessment

The project will ease movement of traffic on the road. The traffic congestion will
be relieved. Congestion often creates emission of carbon from standing vehicles
with engine on. Since the vehicles will be on move the there will very little
emission of carbon.

Project Execution Duration

DDC-DATEX

Traffic delay causes delay in distribution of goods, delay in business
transactions. All these finally, will lead to economic loss. Free movement of traffic
on the highway and service roads will relieve the economy from national
economic loss. The efficiency of local highway will be increased. Apart from local
traffic movement, it will also allow free movement of international traffic from
India, Nepal and Bhutan moving to Mongla Port.

Rooftop Solar Energy Project for Urban Household
In modern days’ electric power is one of the most important input to keep the
wheel of development running. Bangladesh is a country of electric power deficit.
Its development is challenged by severe scarcity of electricity. Out of 25 million
households of the country only 4.2 million could so far be brought under the
conventional electric supply system. According to the World Bank, it would take
about 35 years to bring all households of the country under electricity coverage.
Vast rural households still remain out of the reach of electric power. Even in
urban areas, there is frequent power cut due to shortage of electricity production.
To reduce pressure on conventional energy sources, government is emphasizing
on the renewable energy, like solar power. Bangladesh is richly endowed with
solar energy. Solar Home System (SHS) can serve as a very good alternative to
electric power for operating household appliances including lighting. Though
initial cost is high, it saves huge sum in the long run. It is a green technology and
environment friendly. In Dhaka city, RAJUK has imposed the condition of
installing roof top solar energy system for approval of high rise building plans. In
future similar conditions will also be introduced in other major cities of the
country.
The main components of a solar energy system include, a solar panel, a battery
and a charge controller. The entire system can be operated with simple training.
A small SHS photovoltaic (PV) system can illuminate house and power other
home appliances, like, light, radio, small television. In photovoltaic system sun
light is converted into electric power without using any moving power. No fossil
fuel is required as sun light is the main raw material. In Bangladesh, except
monsoon, sun light is widely available; it is also reasonable and reliable fuel
source. With the little maintenance of the equipment, the solar home system can
run smoothly and generate electricity for decades. The user can use the energy
for operating light, radio, refrigerator, TV, fan and water pump and continue his
economic activities and livelihood.
- To reduce dependency on conventional electricity;
- To protect environment;
- To promote social and economic development in areas devoid of electric
power.
The project may be implemented by the house owners or by any individual with
the technical assistance of SHS system supplier.
Affordability: Initial cost of the project is high, but over the longer the project
cost comes down. But most urban dwellers have comparatively higher level of
income and the project will be affordable to them. NGOs offer this system on
credit. So, middle and lower middle income people will be able to purchase the
system considering its overall benefits. Grameen Shakti has already installed
over 1 million SHS systems in rural Bangladesh successfully. If rural households
can afford it, urban households can afford it too, as they have higher income
compared to rural people.
Installation: The SHS system is easy and simple. It does not require any extra
space, so there is no need for additional land. The equipment can be installed on
the rooftop and within the house. The user can himself maintain the system with
simple training.

This is a green technology. There is no chance of pollution. It does not make any
noise, does not create smoke.
Compared to other sources of energy, the initial cost of SHS is higher, but over
the longer period it gives good amount of savings. More over, quality of light is
good compared to kerosene. It allows watching TV, a very essential component
of modern urban life. Good lighting allows to do study by student. It also helps
doing many other economic activities leading to increased production and
generating employment. The package under description will cost Tk. 1,11,000.00

Sub-sector: Employment Generation in Inform Economic Sector

Project Title
Project Components
Background of the
Project

Employment Generation by Promotion of Inform Economic Activities on
Footpath
As a developing country, informal sector in Bangladesh plays a significant
role in urban employment generation. Due to scarcity of formal job, the new
poor migrants arriving from rural areas find their livelihood in informal
economic activities. Informal economic activities have the following
characteristics,
- they use small capital and simple technology;
- some of them have fixed location, while others move from place to place;
- they don’t have access to formal credit system;
- those who have fixed location, usually use public land for their activities;
- they are not recognized by any government agency that is, there is no
record of the informal sector operators in the government record;
- they do not pay taxes.
Informal sector operators usually operate in areas where there are public
gathering that is they have customers. They sell their products at a very
cheap rate,, thus serving the lower income urban dwellers. In Bangladesh,
informal sector is the largest source of employment in urban areas. Like
other urban centres of the country, there are informal economic activities in
Khulna City. But, as they do not have any recognition from the government
agencies, they actually operate illegally occupying footpath and other public
land. But since they have great contribution in employment generation, there
is increasing international recommendation that they should be promoted in
order to create employment and income of the urban poor. This is seen as an
important measure towards poverty reduction in developing countries.

Recommendation of Khulna
2001 Khulna Structure Plan in Section ‘5.6 Informal Sector Development’
2001 Master Plan, Five year
(page-68) made some recommendations about development of informal
plan, Annual Development
sector. The report noted that informal sector in Khulna City would continue
plan
to play significant role in the city. The report says,
‘Development of the informal sector, side by side with the formal sector will
increase competition, reduce cost increase efficiency and productivity of both
the sectors. To enhance the efficiency of the informal sector, the following
attempts can be important and beneficial’
* Innovation and desired improvement through continuous marketing
research
* Provision of marketing facilities
* Making raw materials available at competitive price
* Provision of space for establishing microenterprises
* Skill training
* Management training
* Financial services (savings and credit)

NGOs should be engaged to provide these services with active involvement
in monitoring and coordination through the concerned Government agrees
like BSCIC, Handloom Board, NGO Bureau, Department of Youths, Women
Affairs Department, Social Services Department BRDB, Fisheries, Livestock
and Cooperatives.’
This is a pilot project aims to see that hawkers doing business on the city can
be rehabilitated in a footpath in an organized way without disturbing the
pedestrians moving on footpath. For the project a 300 ft. long footpath from
Sonali Bank to Old Ferry Ghat Bus Terminal near Bazar Post Office on the
Khan-e-Sabur Road has been selected. Width of the existing footpath space
is 5 ft. The footpath will remain as it is. There is a wide unused paved space
after footpath that is used for on street parking. The space available in the
site is more than needed for parking. This space is recommended to be
made available for hawker rehabilitation. Already vendors are doing their
business occupying a part of footpath and the pavement. The project aims to
legally settle10 hawkers in this site on one year lease basis. After the
footpath a 40 sft space (4 feet x 10 feet) will be allotted to each hawker for a
monthly rent of Tk. 16 per square feet. The allottees will operate their
business from 3:00 pm to 8:pm. They will be provided with electricity
connection and the bill will be paid by them.The hawkers will be issued
allotment letters as a proof of legality of their business.This will be a pilot
project for rehabilitating the footpath hawkers. If the project is successful
KCC may continue renew lease for one year again. But if the project does
not produce expected results, it may be shut down.
Please see Figure-5.3 for the location and site design.
